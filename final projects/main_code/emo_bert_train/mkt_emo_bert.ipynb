BUSINESS\\n\\nInception and Organization\\n\\nPART I\\n\\nFluence Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“the Company”), was formed on June 21, 2021. We conduct our business operations through Fluence\\nEnergy, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Fluence Energy, LLC was formed on June 30, 2017 as a joint venture between Siemens Industry, Inc.\\n(“Siemens Industry”), an indirect subsidiary of Siemens AG (“Siemens”), and AES Grid Stability, LLC (“AES Grid Stability”), an indirect subsidiary of\\nthe AES Corporation (“AES”), and commenced operations on January 1, 2018. We refer to Siemens Industry and AES Grid Stability as the “Founders” in\\nthis Annual Report.\\n\\nOn December 27, 2020, Fluence Energy, LLC entered into an agreement with QIA Florence Holdings LLC (“QFH” or the “Blocker Company”) for a\\n$125.0 million investment to accelerate our growth and the global deployment of our offerings. QFH is an affiliate of the Qatar Investment Authority\\n(“QIA”), the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar, and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Following the completion of the transaction on June 9, 2021, Siemens\\nIndustry,  AES  Grid  Stability  and  QFH  (collectively,  the  “Original  LLC  Owners”)  held  43.2%,  43.2%  and  13.6%,  respectively,  of  the  limited  liability\\ninterests (the “LLC Interests”) of Fluence Energy, LLC.\\n\\nExcept where the content clearly indicates otherwise, any reference in this Annual Report to “Fluence,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “the Company” refers to\\nFluence Energy, Inc. and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Fluence Energy, LLC. When used in a historical context that is prior to the\\ncompletion of our IPO (defined below) on November 1, 2021, “we,” “us,” “our” or “the Company” refer to Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries.\\n\\nInitial Public Offering and Related Transactions\\n\\nOn November 1, 2021, the Company completed an initial public offering (the “IPO”) in which it issued and sold 35,650,000 shares of its Class A\\ncommon stock, par value $0.00001 per share, at the public offering price of $28.00 per share, which includes the exercise by the underwriters of their\\noption to purchase an additional 4,650,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. The net proceeds to the Company from the IPO were $935.8\\nmillion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company.\\n\\nWe consummated the following transactions in connection with the IPO (collectively with the IPO, the “Transactions”):\\n\\n• we  amended  and  restated  the  existing  limited  liability  company  agreement  of  Fluence  Energy,  LLC,  which  became  effective  prior  to  the\\nconsummation of the IPO, to, among other things, (1) recapitalize all existing ownership interests in Fluence Energy, LLC into 135,666,665 LLC\\nInterests and (2) appoint Fluence Energy, Inc. as the sole managing member of Fluence Energy, LLC upon its acquisition of LLC Interests;\\n\\n• we amended and restated Fluence Energy, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation to, among other things, provide (1) for Class A common stock, with\\neach share of our Class A common stock entitling its holder to one vote per share on all matters presented to our stockholders generally, (2) for\\nClass B-1 common stock, with each share of our Class B-1 common stock entitling its holder to five votes per share on all matters presented to our\\nstockholders generally, (3) for Class B-2 common stock, with each share of our Class B-2 common stock entitling its holder to one vote per share\\non all matters presented to our stockholders generally, and that shares of our Class B-1 and Class B-2 common stock may only be held by the\\nFounders and their respective permitted transferees;\\n\\n• we acquired, by means of one or more mergers (the “Blocker Mergers”), the Blocker Company and issued to its owner, Qatar Holding LLC (the\\n\\n“Blocker Shareholder”), 18,493,275 shares of our Class A common stock as consideration in the Blocker Mergers;\\n\\n• we  issued  117,173,390  shares  of  our  Class  B-1  common  stock  to  the  Founders,  which  is  equal  to  the  number  of  LLC  Interests  held  by  such\\n\\nFounders, for nominal consideration;\\n\\n• we used the net proceeds from the IPO to purchase 35,650,000 newly issued LLC Interests directly from Fluence Energy, LLC at a price per unit\\nequal to the initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock in the IPO less the underwriting discount and estimated offering\\nexpenses payable by us;\\n\\n•\\n\\nFluence Energy, LLC used the net proceeds from the sale of LLC Interests to Fluence Energy, Inc. to repay all outstanding borrowings under our\\nexisting Line of Credit and the Promissory Notes (each as defined in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\\nof Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources”), and intends to use the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes;\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##• AES  Grid  Stability,  Siemens  Industry,  and  the  Blockers  Shareholder  (collectively,  the  “Continuing  Equity  Owners”)  and  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.\\nentered into (1) the Stockholders Agreement (the “Stockholders Agreement”) and the (2) the Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration\\nRights  Agreement”),  and  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.,  Fluence  Energy,  LLC,  and  the  Founders  entered  into  a  tax  receivable  agreement  (the  “Tax\\nReceivable Agreement”). See “Item 7.

Our energy storage products are built on our sixth-generation technology stack (“Tech Stack”), which combines our modular,\\nfactory-built hardware (“Fluence Cube”) with a proprietary edge-based controls system (“Fluence OS”). Our service offerings include delivery services and\\nrecurring operational services, as well as financing structuring services, such as energy-storage-as-a-service (“ESaaS”). The Fluence IQ Digital Platform\\nincludes Fluence Mosaic, which delivers AI-powered market bidding optimization for solar, wind, and energy storage assets, including non-Fluence energy\\nstorage systems.\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##As of September 30, 2022, we had 1.8 gigawatts (“GW”) of energy storage assets deployed and 3.7 GW of contracted backlog across 44 markets in 36\\ncountries  with  a  gross  global  pipeline  of  37.7  GW.  As  of  September  30,  2022,  our  global  operational  and  maintenance  (“O&M”)  services  team  was\\nproviding services for 2.0 GW of energy storage assets, with a further 2.0 GW of contracted backlog. See the “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and\\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operating Metrics” for additional information regarding our deployed assets, contracted\\nbacklog and pipeline.\\n\\nIn  October  2020,  we  acquired  the  software  and  digital  intelligence  platform  of  Advanced  Microgrid  Solutions  (“AMS”),  a  leading  artificial\\nintelligence-enabled optimized bidding software for utility-scale storage and renewable generation assets. In April 2022, the Company entered into a share\\nsale purchase agreement and acquired all outstanding shares, the assets and assumed the liabilities of Nispera AG (“Nispera”), a Zurich based provider of\\nartificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  machine  learning-enabled  software-as-a-service  (SaaS)  targeting  the  renewable  energy  sector.  The software we acquired\\nfrom AMS became Fluence Mosaic. As of September 30, 2022, we had an aggregate of 13.7 GW of renewable energy assets using Fluence Mosaic and 3.6\\nGW of contracted backlog related to renewable and energy storage assets. We expect our services and Fluence IQ digital applications, including Fluence\\nMosaic, to expand meaningfully over the next five years and contribute increasingly to our bottom-line growth.\\n\\nOur Industry and Market Opportunity\\n\\nClimate change is an existential threat. Severe weather events and broader awareness of the financial implications of climate change are driving a\\nsystemic global transition away from fossil fuels towards sustainable energy systems. However, renewable generation, unlike fossil fuel generation, has no\\ninherent storage capacity and can only be used in favorable wind and solar conditions. Energy storage is therefore a critical enabler of large-scale adoption\\nof  24/7  renewable  energy.  Furthermore,  accelerating  electrification  of  industries  such  as  transportation  is  driving  demand  for  more  generation.  Energy\\nstorage can help both serve and smooth additional peak demand, improving grid reliability and managing energy requirements.\\n\\nAs the first truly digital asset on the electric grid, energy storage is also a uniquely flexible tool for grid planners, operators, and power providers. We\\nbelieve energy storage sits at the epicenter of the global clean energy transition and represents the backbone of a massive change in our energy market\\ninfrastructure driven by three key trends: Grid modernization, decarbonization, and digitalization. The energy transformation will require $134 trillion of\\ninvestment  through  2050  based  on  the  midpoint  of  Bloomberg  New  Energy  Finance’s  (“BloombergNEF”)  New  Energy  Outlook  (“NEO”)  2021  clean\\nelectricity and green hydrogen pathway.\\n\\nGovernments across the globe have announced and implemented various policies, regulation and legislation to support the transition from fossil fuels\\nto low-carbon forms of energy which will act as potential catalysts to our growth in the Americas, Europe and Asia. For Example, In August 2022, the\\nUnited States passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), which includes a number of government incentives that support the adoption of\\nenergy storage products and services and are anticipated to benefit the Company and its operations. Refer to the Government Regulation and Compliance\\nsection for further discussion.\\n\\nEnergy Storage Market Opportunity\\n\\nThe energy storage market is comprised of three components:\\n\\n• Energy storage products — the components (including batteries), professional services, and labor required to manufacture, assemble, and install\\nproducts. The energy storage products market is driven by the deployment of new energy storage products globally, and its addressable market is comprised\\nof the annual spend associated with the manufacturing, delivery, and installation of new energy storage products. According to BloombergNEF, global\\nannual energy storage capacity installations, excluding the residential market, grew from 0.6 GW a year in 2015 to 16 GW a year in 2022, and are expected\\nto grow to 72 GW a year by 2030. We believe most forecasts for the energy storage sector, including BloombergNEF’s, understate the size and market\\nopportunity as forecasts generally only account for spend associated with the physical energy storage asset and do not account for the associated service\\nand digital spend.\\n\\n• Services — recurring operational and maintenance services that energy storage products require, management services that are provided by third\\nparties when asset owners outsource the operations of their systems, and the provision of ESaaS. The services market is driven by the growth in installed\\nenergy storage products globally, and its addressable market is comprised of the recurring annual service spend across the entire fleet of energy storage\\nproducts, which is continuing to grow through new product installations. According to BloombergNEF, global installed energy storage capacity, excluding\\nthe residential market, grew 57% per annum between 2015 and 2020, and the installed base is expected to grow at a 31% annual growth rate through 2030.\\nBloombergNEF forecasts that global installed energy storage capacity will reach 193.7 GW by 2030, excluding the residential market.\\n\\n• Digital applications and solutions  —  operating  systems,  applications,  such  as  trading  platforms  that  allow  system  owners  to  manage  their  grid\\nparticipation.  These  trading  platforms  can  be  deployed  on  both  energy  storage  assets  and  renewable  and  conventional  generation  assets.  The  digital\\napplications and solutions sector is driven by the growth in installed energy storage products and renewable and conventional generation assets, and its\\naddressable market is comprised of the total global installed fleet of energy storage products and renewable and conventional generation assets. The digital\\napplications and solutions economic model\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##is primarily structured as (i) $/kilowatt (“kW”) recurring fixed fees, and in some cases (ii) $/kW performance-based incentive fees both calculated based on\\nthe GWs of storage and generation assets on which digital applications and solutions service offerings are deployed. We believe there is an opportunity to\\nnot only deploy digital applications and solutions on individual assets but also across entire energy storage fleets and portfolios of generation assets to\\nimprove their collective performance and economic output, and to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the electric grid by optimizing the interactions\\nbetween different asset types.\\n\\nWe believe there are multiple factors driving continued growth in the energy storage sector, including:\\n\\n• The accelerating transition from fossil to renewable generation is expected to require significant increases in energy storage capacity to both offset\\npotential  grid  instability  caused  by  intermittent  renewable  resources  and  enable  the  use  of  power  from  renewable  generation  assets  at  times  when  the\\nnatural resource is unavailable.\\n\\n•  Growing  capacity  constraints  on  existing  power  grids  that  were  not  designed  to  support  distributed  and  renewable  generation  infrastructure  or\\n\\ntechnologies such as electric vehicles are positioning energy storage assets as a key solution.\\n\\n• As predicted by IHS Markit, a forecasted reduction in the battery cost by 2024 is expected to improve the economics of energy storage and support\\n\\nthe development of larger energy storage systems.\\n\\n• Environmental responsibility has become a priority for major companies and investors, with over 300 major companies having pledged to source\\n\\n100% of their energy from renewables as part of the RE100, a global corporate renewable energy initiative.\\n\\n• Governments across the globe have announced policies to support the transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon forms of energy.\\n\\nOur Products and Services\\n\\nOur offerings include energy storage products and delivery services, recurring operational services and digital solutions and applications for energy\\nstorage and other power assets. We may refer to our energy storage products as “Solutions” and use this term interchangeably as it is more reflective of\\noffering provided to our customers. We have repeatedly pioneered new use cases for grid-scale energy storage. Some of the uses we have supported include\\nfrequency regulation, generation enhancement, capacity peak power, energy cost control, microgrids/islands, renewable integration, virtual dams, T&D\\nenhancement, and critical power.\\n\\nEnergy Storage Products\\n\\nWe sell highly configurable energy storage products with integrated hardware, software and digital intelligence. We offer four energy storage products\\n\\nbuilt on our sixth-generation Tech Stack foundation, which are optimized for common customer use cases but can be configured for specific use cases:\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n• Gridstack™:   grid-scale, industrial-strength energy storage product designed for demanding market applications with industry-leading reliability,\\nscalability,  and  safety.

The fully integrated product is available in smaller-size building blocks that can be easily configured to meet the needs\\nof individual facilities and aggregated across fleets or locations without time-consuming redesigns.\\n\\n• Ultrastack™:  the entities that control and operate our electricity system are facing significant reliability challenges as the grid moves away from\\nhigher-cost thermal generation assets and increasingly relies on energy from lower-cost but variable renewables and low carbon sources. Fluence\\nhas  developed  a  storage  solution  to  serve  the  unique  performance  needs  of  transmission  and  distribution  system  owners  and  operators  in  this\\nsegment, including stringent requirements around availability, uptime, and IT security. The solution will feature redundant controls and metering,\\nfast system response, and advanced controls applications that deliver a suite of highly technical grid services, such as synthetic inertia and power\\noscillation  damping.  These  applications  are  designed  to  reduce  grid  congestion,  support  stable  system  operation,  and  help  operators  increase\\nutilization of existing and new transmission assets, which in turn reduces the total cost of electricity to consumers. Advanced controls capabilities\\nfor this solution have been in active development and will be fully tested at Fluence’s global product testing facilities prior to production and\\nproject deliveries in this segment.\\n\\nIn addition, each of our products comes with our proprietary controls software, Fluence OS, which enables asset owners to operate the storage system\\ndirectly with pre-set modes and market dispatch applications or integrate directly with external ISO and EMS signals. OS provides real-time information\\nthrough multiple systems views, alarm notifications, and dashboards. It is an integral part of all our energy storage product sales. Fluence OS enables\\nFluence energy storage products to deliver critical grid services such as\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##primary  frequency  regulation,  secondary  frequency  response,  fast  frequency  response,  peak  shaving,  voltage  regulation,  power  factor  regulation,  non-\\nspinning reserves, capacity peak power, solar energy time-shifting, firm solar export, energy arbitrage, and more. Fluence also delivers stacking of grid\\nservices, allowing storage assets to perform multiple services simultaneously and increase revenue-generating opportunities.\\n\\nWe also offer comprehensive engineering and delivery services to support the deployment of our storage products. Customers can select from a range\\n\\nof delivery service, from project design to full-wrap turnkey installation.\\n\\nWe have designed our energy storage products to allow for licensing to third-party partners, and plan to offer the ability to license Fluence products,\\n\\nservices, and digital applications to partners targeting specific geographies and market use cases.\\n\\nSixth-Generation Technology Stack\\n\\nThe Tech Stack, which is comprised of our Fluence Cube, Fluence OS, and Fluence IQ, builds upon 14 years of development in prior generations,\\nreflecting ongoing safety and design improvements.

The Company’s products and services enable more sustainable, reliable, and resilient electric grids in a repeatable, scalable way.\\n\\nFluence’s mission to “Transform the way we power our world” is not just a tagline but at the core of what we do and that includes our Company’s\\n\\nSustainability Program. In fiscal year 2022, we took a purposeful approach to establishing what\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) practices mean to us and to our business. The Company’s first step was to establish a\\ncore leadership role responsible for the program development and implementation. We then consolidated our environmental stewardship and responsible\\nsourcing practices within the Company for greater support and progress. We are building our Sustainability Program upon three key pillars:\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\nReporting & Stakeholder Engagement\\nEnvironmental Stewardship & Compliance\\nResponsible Sourcing & Social Compliance\\n\\nReporting & Stakeholder Engagement\\n\\nFluence believes in holding ourselves accountable to our employees, our customers, our partners, and our shareholders. We emphasize transparency as\\nthe foundation of our accountability in our Sustainability Program. However, transparency cannot be achieved in a vacuum and we purposely work to\\nleverage our employees’ passion, leadership and management support, and our supply chain partners to remain in a constant stage of improvement.\\n\\nFluence’s Sustainability Program is governed by two internal committees – our ESG Council and ESG Steering. These are cross functional leadership\\nteams responsible for gathering alignment and support across the organization to advance our ESG initiatives. The ESG Council is made up of leadership\\nrepresenting  key  internal  stakeholders  (including  individuals  with  expertise  in  environment,  supply  chain,  human  resources,  health  and  safety,  legal,\\nmarketing, finance, ethics, and logistics). They are responsible for resource allocation and implementation. The ESG Council reports to our ESG Steering,\\nwhich is comprised of five executive leaders (our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Supply Chain\\nand Manufacturing Officer, and General Counsel).\\n\\nIn  fiscal  year  2022,  we  committed  to  publishing  our  first  annual  sustainability  report  in  February/March  2023,  which  we  intend  to  align  with  the\\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) Fuel Cells & Industrial Batteries standard in addition to those standards promulgated by both the\\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). We intend that our inaugural sustainability\\nreport will include our Scope I & II Green House Gas (“GHG”) baseline, and certain portions of our Scope III emissions as well as other important topics\\nincluding  environmental  performance,  responsible  sourcing,  stakeholder  engagement,  governance,  philanthropy,  community  engagement,  financial\\nperformance, and safety.\\n\\nEnvironmental Stewardship & Compliance\\n\\nThe  Company  is  demonstrating  our  commitment  to  preserving  the  planet’s  natural  resources  through,  among  other  things,  the  implementation  of\\nindustry best practices and procedures to measure and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from facilities, supply chain logistics, and employee travel;\\nmeasuring  our  waste  output  and  maximizing  systems  to  divert  waste  away  from  landfills;  and  developing  and  implementing  a  product  recycling\\ncompetency.  We  employ  a  holistic  and  stakeholder  driven  approach  by  bringing  together  internal  stakeholder  teams  like  total  quality  management,\\nenvironmental health and safety, engineering, supply chain management, and others on these measures and the data we collect in these efforts will be used\\nto develop responsive actions by us that will continuously reduce our environmental impact.\\n\\nOver the last two years, our acumen for developing environmental management systems and achieving continuous improvement of its environmental\\nperformance has been demonstrated by our certification of the ISO 14001 standard at our corporate office in Arlington, Virginia and the testing facility in\\nErlangen,  Germany  which  requires  an  organization  to  implement  and  demonstrate  compliance  with  an  effective  environmental  management  system  to\\nidentify and control the environmental impact of its activities, products, and services; continually improve environmental performance; and implement a\\nsystematic approach to setting environmental objectives and targets. We are now working to expand our ISO 14001 certification with the ultimate goal of\\ncertifying all relevant Fluence facilities.\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing & Compliance\\n\\nFluence is committed to social accountability. We are committed to ensure supply chain compliance with our core philosophies of human rights &\\ndignity, supply chain risk aversion and conflict minerals risk management. Our responsible sourcing and compliance is based on the principles spelled out\\nin our Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of Conduct sets the social conduct expectations for all persons and entities connected to the Fluence\\nvalue stream. We implement this with a three phase approach, supplier qualification, supplier evaluation and supplier development processes.\\n\\nSome of our core programs developed over the past two years are our Conflict Minerals Due Diligence Program, Supplier GHG (Greenhouse Gas)\\nEmissions Disclosures and a Supplier Social Accountability Auditing program. We are leading our value chain in Social Accountability Standards by being\\nSA8000 certified and expect our business partners to show similar commitments to human\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##rights and against slavery and child labor. Feedback from our due diligence and auditing programs allows us to map and score our supply chain partners. As\\nwe move forward, the Company intends to maintain the highest expectations for responsible sourcing in our value chain.\\n\\nHuman Capital Management\\n\\nWe believe our workforce is critical to our success and we strive to create a positive, equitable, and safe work environment. To create a culture of\\ntransparency, we maintain a regular cadence of communications from the executive leadership team to employees, including emails, all hands meetings,\\nQ&A sessions, and employee resource groups with executive sponsors.\\n\\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 967 full-time employees. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor\\nunion. As of September 30, 2022, approximately 85 of our employees in Germany were represented by a works council. We have not experienced any\\nemployment-related work stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.\\n\\nWe  believe  that  our  purpose-driven  culture  has  fostered  a  work  environment  in  which  employees  feel  supported,  empowered  to  develop  in  their\\ncareers,  and  fulfilled  in  their  work.  Initiatives  driven  by  this  culture  include  professional  development  courses  made  available  to  all  employees,  and  a\\npartnership  with  Inova  through  which  we  provide  free  professional  and  wellness  services  to  employees.  To  assess  and  continually  improve  employee\\nsentiment,  we  conduct  regular  employee  surveys  soliciting  feedback  on  topics  such  as  work/life  balance,  working  remotely,  career  development,  and\\nmentorship.\\n\\nFluence is internationally certified to ISO 9001, a quality management standard that ensures a commitment to customer satisfaction, purpose-driven\\nleadership, and equitable involvement for all employees. Fluence is also internationally certified to ISO 45001, an occupational health and safety standard\\nwhich requires certain proactive measures to ensure employee safety and reduce workplace risks. Fluence’s corporate headquarters is certified to SA8000,\\nwhich demonstrates our commitment to the elimination of unethical and discriminatory labor practices, while affirming workers’ rights, livable wages, and\\ntreating all people with dignity.\\n\\nFluence is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion that makes our employees feel safe and engaged. We have conducted trainings for\\nhiring  managers  on  how  to  avoid  bias  in  the  interview  process  and  formed  a  diversity  and  inclusion  working  group  to  identify  and  address  areas  for\\nimprovement. Women currently represent 30% of our total workforce and 27% of our key corporate management roles as of September 30, 2022.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022 we opened a new technology center in India, becoming Fluence’s first technology center based in Asia. The Fluence India\\nTechnology  Centre  complements  existing  technology  center  teams  in  North  America  and  Europe.  Together,  the  company’s  technology  teams  support\\nFluence’s regionally focused operational model and create a strong foundation for new product introductions and regionalized product support.\\n\\nManufacturing\\n\\nOur manufacturing strategy is designed to meet our key objectives: limit capital-intensive and low value-added activities that can be outsourced to\\nother companies; maintain a capital light business model; minimize labor content where possible; minimize the amount of assembly our customers are\\nrequired to do at the site; and minimize material movement both from vendors to us and within factories.\\n\\nMass manufacturing is a cornerstone of our product delivery approach and a key to driving down product cost and delivering at scale. We aim to create\\nan  optimized  production  organization,  develop  mass  manufacturing  capabilities  globally  through  contract  manufacturing,  and  continue  to  secure\\npartnerships with key battery suppliers. We believe that enhancing our product-focused model and supply chain leverage will support our global growth\\nobjectives and result in superior unit economics.\\n\\nWe have entered outsourcing contracts for the assembly and production of our Fluence Cube, which ship directly from our contract manufacturers to\\njob sites or designated warehouses. By using regional contract manufacturers, we can drop ship products directly to our customers’ sites, which improves\\nworking capital turnover, quality, and inventory management.\\n\\nIn September of 2022 we partnered with a contract manufacturer to open a new manufacturing facility in the United States to better serve regional\\ndelivery and address ongoing supply chain constraints. The facility is located in Utah and will serve the company’s customers in North America. The\\naddition of this contract manufacturing facility expands our production beyond Asia to meet increasing global demand and allow Fluence to better serve\\nregional markets. We intend to expand manufacturing to sites in Europe.\\n\\nFluence also created two spare parts hubs in Europe and the United States to support ongoing operations and maintenance of its customers’ storage\\nassets. These hubs, located in Utah and Ireland, both became operational in fiscal year 2022, and are strategically positioned near large storage markets and\\ncustomer fleets.\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##We  have  developed  a  global  supply  chain  with  an  evolving  regionally  focused  operational  model  with  the  objective  of  allowing  us  to  assemble\\nproducts in proximity to major markets to minimize material movement, working capital investment, and costs of goods sold. Additionally, we believe that\\nthe volume of key components we purchase, such as lithium-ion batteries, should provide us leverage to create a competitive advantage on availability,\\nterms and/or pricing from our suppliers. We have a technology co-development and supply agreement with Northvolt that should expand our battery supply\\nchain  into  Europe.  Pursuant  to  this  agreement,  we  have  a  license  to  develop,  manufacture  and  commercialize  an  optimized  battery  subsystem  that  is\\nsignificantly  more  energy  dense  than  today’s  standard  solutions.  The  agreement  also  enables  us  to  deploy  a  battery  management  system  that  can  be\\nintegrated with other vendors to extend our value chain, develop battery competencies, and lower total cost of ownership.\\n\\nIntellectual Property\\n\\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies, information, processes and know-\\nhow.  We  rely  primarily  on  patent,  trademark,  copyright  and  trade  secret  laws,  confidentiality  agreements  and  procedures,  and  other  contractual\\narrangements to protect our technology. Fluence also has a perpetual license (terminable in the event of an uncured material breach) to certain patents and\\nother intellectual property that belong to AES and Siemens, including methods for cooling inverters, overvoltage protections, and transfer of large amounts\\nof data (methodology).\\n\\nWe rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary know-how and software that is\\nnot patented and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce. We believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary\\nknow-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs, algorithms, and\\nprocedures.\\n\\nWe require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or\\n\\nbusiness plans.\\n\\nSeasonality\\n\\nWe have historically experienced seasonality and see increased order intake in our third and fourth fiscal quarters, driven by demand in the Northern\\nHemisphere  to  install  energy  storage  products  before  the  summer  of  the  following  year.  Combined  third  and  fourth  fiscal  quarter  order  intake  has\\nhistorically accounted for 80% or more of our total intake each year. However, as we and the market matures we are experiencing less seasonality. For\\nfiscal year 2022 third and fourth quarter order intake accounted for only 48% of our total intake for the year.\\n\\nAs a result, revenue recognition is typically stronger in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Cash flows historically have been negative in our first and\\nsecond fiscal quarters, neutral to positive in our third fiscal quarter, and positive in our fourth fiscal quarter. Our services and digital application offerings\\ndo not experience the same seasonality given their recurring nature.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nOur products, services, and digital applications are highly specialized and specific to the clean energy industry. The unique expertise required to design\\nthese offerings as well as customers’ reluctance to try unproven products has confined the number of firms that produce such products to a relatively small\\nnumber, particularly in the segments we are targeting. In addition, we are continuously engaging in developing new use cases and opening new market\\nsegments, which are often less contested.\\n\\nOur  principal  competitors  include  Tesla,  Wartsila,  and  Powin  but  competition  varies  by  geography,  grid  service  or  customer  segment.  A  key\\ndifferentiator is our ability to identify customer needs and deliver customer-centric products, services, and use cases that can compete in the market either\\nas packages or standalone offerings. We believe we compete favorably based on performance and value-creation, including low total cost of ownership,\\nlong-term reliability, varied service options, and convenient and efficient sales and delivery processes.\\n\\nGovernment Regulation and Compliance\\n\\nGreenhouse Gas Emission Related Policies, Regulations and Legislation\\n\\nGovernments across the globe have announced and implemented various policies, regulation and legislation to support the transition from fossil fuels\\nto  low-carbon  forms  of  energy.  The  operation  of  our  business  and  our  customers’  use  of  our  products  and  services  are  impacted  by  these  various\\ngovernment actions. For example, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement effective February 19, 2021, an international climate change agreement\\namong almost 200 nations and the European Union, that established a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature well below 2°C\\nabove pre-industrial levels and which calls for countries to set their own greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions targets and be transparent about the measures\\neach country will use to achieve these targets. In August 2022, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), which consists of\\na number of provisions aimed directly at confronting the climate change crisis. The climate-related provisions of the IRA are projected\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##to cut emissions by 40% from 2005 GHG levels in the United States by 2030. Among other things, the IRA introduced an investment tax credit (ITC) for\\nstandalone energy storage for the first time, which is anticipated to lower capital cost of equipment. The IRA also contains provisions with incentives for\\ndomestic battery manufacturing as well as upstream supply chains. Additional information regarding the tax incentives contained in the IRA are set forth\\nbelow in “----Government Incentives.”\\n\\nInternationally, in June 2021, the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals (the “Fit for 55 package”) as part of the European\\nGreen Deal, which encompasses a number of wide-scale proposals aimed at reducing European GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 and targeting net-zero\\nemissions  by  2050.  Moreover,  the  European  Commission  proposed  the  REPowerEU  Plan  in  May  2022,  which  is  centered  around  the  goal  of  making\\nEurope  independent  from  Russian  fossil  fuels  well  before  2030,  in  light  of  Russia\\'s  invasion  of  Ukraine  early  in  2022.  It  is  meant  to  incentivize  and\\naccelerate  the  transition  to  clean  energy  alternatives  and  aims  to  increase  the  security  of  energy  supply  by  building  and  connecting  more  renewable\\ngeneration to the grid.\\n\\nIn September 2022, Australia passed climate change legislation containing a targeted 43% reduction in the emissions intensity of its economy of 2005\\nGHG levels by 2030 and a reduction to net-zero emissions by 2050. In August 2022, India revised its previous pledge to achieve a 33 – 35% reduction in\\nemissions intensity by 2030 and has committed to reduce emissions intensity by 45% of 2005 GHG levels by 2030 and to achieve about 50% cumulative\\nelectric  power  installed  capacity  from  non-fossil  fuel-based  energy  resources  by  2030.  In  April  2021,  the  Philippines  committed  to  a  projected  GHG\\nemissions reduction and avoidance of 75%, of which 2.71% is unconditional, for the period 2020 to 2030 for the sectors of agriculture, wastes, industry,\\ntransport, and energy.\\n\\nCurrent and future legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could make lower GHG-emitting energy sources, such as\\nsolar and wind, more desirable than higher GHG-emitting energy sources, such as coal and natural gas. As a result, such climate change regulatory and\\nlegislative initiatives with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions would potentially increase the demand for energy storage products and related\\nservices.\\n\\nPolicy Initiatives including Tax Incentives, Cash Grants and Performance Incentives\\n\\nThere are varying policy initiatives across the United States and abroad designed to support and accelerate adoption of clean and/or reliable distributed\\n\\ngeneration technologies. These policy initiatives can come in the form of tax incentives, cash grants, performance incentives, and/or electric tariffs.\\n\\nIn the United States, our energy storage products are currently installed or in delivery in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland,\\nMassachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and West Virginia, and each state has its\\nown enabling policy framework, which is subject to change. Some states have utility procurement programs, energy storage mandates, targets or goals,\\nand/or  renewable  portfolio  standards  for  which  our  technology  is  eligible.  Many  states,  including  California,  Massachusetts,  and  New  York,  offer  tax\\nexemptions or other customer incentives.\\n\\nAlthough  we  generally  are  not  regulated  as  a  utility,  federal,  state,  and  local  government  statutes  and  regulations  concerning  electricity  heavily\\ninfluence  the  market  for  our  product  and  services.  These  statutes  and  regulations  often  relate  to  electricity  pricing,  net  metering,  incentives,  taxation,\\ncompetition with utilities and the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. In the United States, governments continuously modify these\\nstatutes and regulations. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different rates for commercial\\n(and residential) customers on a regular basis. These changes can have a positive or negative impact on our ability to deliver cost savings to customers for\\nthe purchase of electricity.\\n\\nAs noted, several states have an energy storage mandate or policies designed to encourage the adoption of storage, including nine states with specific\\nenergy storage targets as of early 2022. For example, Virginia has a mandate for 3.1 GW of energy storage by 2035, California offers a cash rebate for\\nstorage installations through the Self Generation Incentive Program, and Massachusetts and New York offer performance-based financial incentives for\\nstorage. Other states, including Illinois and Vermont, are studying energy storage deployment policies and there may be further energy storage mandates\\ncoming. Storage installations also are supported in certain states by state public utility commission policies that require utilities to consider alternatives\\nsuch as storage in integrated resource planning proceedings before they can build new generation. Our customers benefit directly under these programs.\\n\\nFERC Support of Energy Storage\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##In addition, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has taken a number of steps to help to enable the participation of energy storage in\\nwholesale energy markets. For  example,  in  February  2018,  FERC  issued  Order  841  directing  regional  transmission  operators  and  independent  system\\noperators  to  remove  barriers  to  the  participation  of  storage  in  wholesale  electricity  markets  and  to  establish  rules  to  help  ensure  storage  resources  are\\ncompensated for the services they provide. Order 841 was upheld in July 2020 following an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, with\\nthe court finding that FERC’s directives to allow distributed storage participation in wholesale electricity markets did not violate the Federal Power Act’s\\njurisdictional line separating FERC’s authority over those markets and states’ authority over local distribution facilities. In September 2020, the FERC\\nissued Order 2222 opening U.S. wholesale energy markets to aggregations of distributed energy resources like rooftop solar, “behind the meter” batteries,\\nand electric vehicles. Additionally, FERC is currently taking public comment on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking to improve interconnection\\nprocedures with proposed design elements such as including grid-enhancing technologies like energy storage in interconnection studies and applications.\\n\\nEnergy  storage  products  require  interconnection  agreements  from  the  applicable  authorities  having  jurisdiction  to  operate.  In  almost  all  cases,\\ninterconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with\\njurisdiction  over  interconnection  agreements.  As  such,  no  additional  regulatory  approvals  are  typically  required  once  interconnection  agreements  are\\nsigned.\\n\\nChanges in or adoption of federal, state and local policies and policy initiatives, legislation and regulations as well as changes in or adoption of policies\\nand policy initiatives, regulations and legislation in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may pose risks or provide opportunities for the Company’s\\nbusiness that may impact our future operations and financial condition. For more information about the potential risks of adoption or changes to such\\npolicies, legislation and regulations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\\n\\nPermits and Approvals\\n\\nEach of our installations or customer installations must be designed, constructed, and operated in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local\\nregulations, codes, standards, guidelines, policies, and laws. To install and operate energy storage products on our platform, we, our customers, or our\\npartners, as applicable, are required to obtain applicable permits and approvals from local authorities having jurisdiction to install energy storage products\\nand to interconnect the products with the local electrical utility.\\n\\nGovernment Incentives\\n\\nThe U.S. Congress is continuously reviewing various climate change proposals, incentives and legislation that may support the energy storage industry,\\nincluding in the form of tax credits. IRS private letter ruling 201809003 clarified that energy storage is eligible for federal tax credits if charged primarily\\nby  qualifying  renewable  resources.  In  December  2020,  the  U.S.  Congress  passed  a  spending  bill  that  includes  $35  billion  in  energy  research  and\\ndevelopment programs, a two-year extension of the ITC for solar power, a one-year extension of the Production Tax Credit for wind power projects, and an\\nextension through 2025 for offshore wind tax credits. In June 2021, the White House announced that it was looking into dramatically expanding U.S.\\nproduction  of  lithium  batteries,  rare  earth  minerals,  and  semiconductors,  and  seek  to  stimulate  demand  for  domestically  manufactured  batteries  by\\nexpanding federal energy storage procurement, expanding the ITC to include stationary energy storage as a standalone resource, and instituting power\\ntransmission regulatory reform to support renewable power and stationary energy storage. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the\\nBipartisan Infrastructure Bill, which was signed into law in November 2021, allocated nearly $7 billion to strengthen the U.S. battery supply chain, which\\nincludes producing and recycling critical minerals without new extraction or mining and sourcing materials for domestic manufacturing. Pursuant to this,\\nthe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued notices of intent in February 2022 to provide $2.91 billion to boost production of the advanced batteries that\\nare  critical  to  the  clean  energy  industry,  including  energy  storage.  This  funding  will  support  the  creation  of  new  domestic  manufacturing  facilities  for\\nbatteries and cell components and to support research and development for recycling, reclaiming and adding materials back into the battery supply chain.\\n\\nThe IRA adopted in August 2022, contains a number of tax incentive provisions that would directly support the adoption of energy storage products\\nand services including: (i) the current ITC is extended for ten years for projects that “begin construction” before 2025, including standalone energy storage\\nfor the first time for those projects with a capacity of at least 5 kwh and (ii) will extend the ITC for up to 30% of the cost of installed equipment for ten\\nyears and will step down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 (noting that for projects beginning construction after 2019 that are placed in service before\\nJanuary 1, 2022, the ITC would be set at 26%. Beginning in 2025, the existing energy ITC will be replaced by a Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit\\n(CEITC) or “tech neutral” regime, which is available for any investment in a qualified storage facility that is placed in service after calendar year 2024\\n(prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements will still apply). Finally, the IRA creates the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (AMPC), which\\napplies to clean energy technology components produced in the US and sold after calendar year 2022, including battery cells and battery modules, which\\nwill begin to phase out in 2030. The above tax credits allow certain tax-exempt entities to receive direct payment from the federal government instead of a\\nreduction of their tax liability. In addition, beginning in January 1, 2023, taxpayers can elect to transfer their ITC or CEITC to an unrelated taxpayer on a\\nfacility-by-facility basis for each year in which credit is available. We believe we are well positioned to capture incentives contained in the IRA with our\\nforthcoming battery module manufacturing, as we opened contract manufacturing facility in Utah, our second facility globally, to better serve regional\\ndelivery and address ongoing supply chain constraints. However, as this legislation was recently adopted in August 2022,\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##and forthcoming interagency guidance processes are in early stages, we have not yet seen the impact these IRA related incentives may have on our business\\nand operations as we go forward and cannot guarantee we will realize anticipated benefits of incentives under the IRA.\\n\\nCorporate Information\\n\\nWe file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and\\nCurrent  Reports  on  Form  8-K,  proxy  statements  and  other  information  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (“SEC”).

our business and\\nfuture prospects difficult.\\n\\nWe were established in January 2018 as a joint venture between Siemens and AES. Since then, we have continued to evolve and grow. We have\\nbenefited and continue to benefit from the industry experience and substantial support AES and Siemens provide, but we have a limited history operating\\nour combined business and generating revenue as an independent entity, and therefore a limited history upon which you can base an investment decision.\\nOperating results for future periods are subject to a number of uncertainties and we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability. Our\\nprospects must be considered in light of the risks by companies in the early stages of development, especially those in new and rapidly evolving markets.\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Our future growth in a nascent and rapidly-evolving industry is dependent on a number of factors, including rising demand for clean electric power\\nsolutions that can provide electric power with lower carbon emissions and replacement of conventional generation sources and the adoption speed of digital\\nsoftware  applications  to  modernize  the  efficiency  of  power  assets  and  the  electric  grid.  Among  other  renewable  energy  market  trends,  we  expect  our\\nbusiness results to be driven by declines in the cost of generation of renewable power, decreases in the cost of manufacturing battery modules and cells,\\ncustomer needs for services and digital applications, commercial, legal, regulatory, and political pressure for the reduced use of and reliance on fossil fuels\\nand electric power generation that relies on fossil or other non-renewable fuels, and a rapidly growing energy storage market driven by increasing demand\\nfrom commercial and industrial customers, utilities, and grid operators. However, predicting future revenues and appropriately forecasting and budgeting\\nfor our expenses is difficult, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and take hold and materially affect our business. In particular, global\\ninflationary pressures in the last year have disrupted the historical trend of declining renewable energy costs and declining battery costs, and it is unclear\\nwhen, or if, our market segment will return to the historical trend of declining costs. Our future operations and strategy is therefore subject to all of the risks\\ninherent in light of the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encounter in connection with the growth of any new business in a nascent\\nindustry, as well as those that are specific to our business in particular.\\n\\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\\n\\nWe have incurred net losses on an annual basis since our inception. We incurred net losses of $289.2 million and $162.0 million for the fiscal years\\nended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect our aggregate costs will increase substantially in the foreseeable future and our losses will\\ncontinue as we expect to invest heavily in increasing our customer base, expanding our operations, and operating as a public company. These efforts may\\nprove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. To date,\\nwe  have  financed  our  operations  with  equity  contributions  from  AES  Grid  Stability,  Siemens  Industry,  and  QFH,  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  negative\\nworking capital, and short-term borrowings. Our net cash flow from operations was negative for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and\\n2021. We may not generate positive cash flow from operations or profitability in any given period, and our limited operating history may make it difficult\\nfor you to evaluate our current business and our future prospects.\\n\\nWe have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries,\\nincluding increasing expenses as we continue to grow our business. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly over the next several years\\nas we continue to hire additional personnel, expand our operations and infrastructure, and continue to expand to reach more customers. In addition to the\\nexpected  costs  to  grow  our  business,  we  also  expect  to  incur  additional  legal,  accounting,  and  other  expenses  as  a  newly  public  company.  These\\ninvestments may be more costly than we expect, and if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the realization of these\\nbenefits is delayed, they may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. If our growth rate were to decline significantly or become negative,\\nit could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to achieve or maintain positive cash flow in the long term, we\\nmay require additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and/or which would be dilutive to our stockholders. If we are\\nunable  to  successfully  address  these  risks  and  challenges  as  we  encounter  them,  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  would  be\\nadversely affected. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our common stock.\\n\\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience delays, disruptions, and/or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations in part due\\nto our third-party manufacturer concentration, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\\n\\nOur product development, manufacturing, and testing protocols are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise.\\nWe currently depend on a limited number of third-party manufacturers, including for key components of our products. As of today, we have one major\\ncontract manufacturer for the Fluence Cube along with another final assembly facility for the Fluence Cube and are planning to expand our set of partners\\nin  the  near  term.  As  we  introduce  new  products,  we  plan  to  continue  to  evaluate  the  economic  benefits  to  Fluence  and  will  expand  our  regional\\nmanufacturing capabilities to further support customers in in all regions. Moreover, we have launched our Americas regional manufacturing capabilities\\ntoday and will further develop the EMEA market once the demand targets are achieved. While the risk of relying on a single vendor will diminish with\\nregional and footprint optimization, expansion may be delayed by the process of vetting and qualifying new manufacturing partners. Further, any vendor\\ndelay or disruption could cause a delay or disruption in our ability to meet customer requirements which may result in a loss of customers. Such processes\\ninvolve a number of precise steps from design to production.\\n\\nAny change in our processes could cause one or more production errors, requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the\\nerrors  can  be  researched,  identified,  and  properly  addressed  and  rectified.  This  may  occur  particularly  as  we  introduce  new  products,  modify  our\\nengineering and production techniques, and/or expand our capacity. In addition, our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result\\nin increased product failures, loss of customers, increased warranty\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##reserve, or increased production and logistics costs, delays and liquidated damages to our customers. Any of these developments could have a material\\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nWe have experienced and may continue to be exposed to risks associated with construction, utility interconnection, commissioning and installation of\\nour products, inflationary cost overruns from increased shipping and logistics prices as well as increased prices on raw materials necessary for the\\nproduction of lithium-ion batteries, and delays, including those related to obtaining government authorizations and permits and other contingencies\\nthat may arise in the course of completing installations.\\n\\nAlthough  we  generally  are  not  regulated  as  a  utility,  federal,  state,  and  local  government  statutes  and  regulations  concerning  electricity  heavily\\ninfluence the market for our products and services. These statutes and regulations often relate to electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, and\\nthe rules surrounding the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation for specific technologies. In the U.S., governments frequently modify\\nthese statutes and regulations. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different requirements for\\nutilities and rates for commercial customers on a regular basis. Changes, or in some cases a lack of change, in any of the laws, regulations, ordinances, or\\nother rules that apply to customer installations and new technology could make it more costly for our customers to install and operate our energy storage\\nproducts on particular sites, and in turn could negatively affect our ability to deliver cost savings to customers for the purchase of electricity.\\n\\nThe installation and operation of our energy storage products at a particular site are also generally subject to oversight and regulation in accordance\\nwith federal, state, and local laws and ordinances relating to building codes, safety, environmental protection, and related matters, and typically require\\nobtaining and keeping in good standing various local and other governmental approvals and permits, including environmental approvals and permits, that\\nvary  by  jurisdiction.  In  some  cases,  these  approvals  and  permits  require  periodic  renewal.  It  is  difficult  and  costly  to  track  the  requirements  of  every\\nindividual authority having jurisdiction over our energy storage product installations, to design our energy storage products to comply with these varying\\nstandards, and for our customers to obtain all applicable necessary approvals and permits. We cannot predict whether or when all permits required for a\\ngiven  customer’s  project  will  be  granted  or  whether  the  conditions  associated  with  the  permits  will  be  achievable.  The  denial  of  a  permit  or  utility\\nconnection essential to a project or the imposition of impractical conditions would impair our customer’s ability to develop the project. In addition, we\\ncannot predict whether the permitting process will be lengthened due to complexities and appeals. Delay in the review and permitting process for a project\\ncan  impair  or  delay  our  customers’  abilities  to  develop  that  project  or  increase  the  cost  so  substantially  that  the  project  is  no  longer  attractive  to  our\\ncustomers. Furthermore, unforeseen delays in the review and permitting process could delay the timing of the installation of our energy storage products\\nand could therefore adversely affect the amount of the recognition of revenue related to the sale of our energy storage products, which could adversely\\naffect our operating results.\\n\\nThe  production  and  installation  of  our  energy  storage  products  also  involves  the  incurrence  of  various  project  costs  and  can  entail  project\\nmodifications. We have policies and procedures regarding the approval of project costs and modifications. In connection with our limited operating history\\nand our significant growth, we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience incurrence of project costs in excess of those budgeted. In\\naddition,  disagreements  with  our  customers  and  suppliers  have  arisen  and  may  in  the  future  arise  with  respect  to  project  schedules,  work,  and\\nmodifications, which can result in the need to find different suppliers, loss of future business, additional costs to us and not fully realizing the anticipated\\nprofit from the project.\\n\\nIn addition, the successful installation of our energy storage products is dependent upon the availability of and timely connection to the local electric\\ngrid. Our customers may be unable to obtain the required consent and authorization of local utilities to ensure successful interconnection to energy grids to\\nenable  the  successful  discharge  of  renewable  energy.  Any  delays  in  our  customers’  ability  to  connect  with  utilities,  delays  in  the  performance  of\\ninstallation-related services, or poor performance of installation-related services will have an adverse effect on our results and could cause operating results\\nto vary materially from period to period.\\n\\nThe interruption of the flow and/or availability of components and materials from international vendors could disrupt our supply chain, including as a\\nresult of the imposition of additional duties, tariffs, and other charges on imports and exports, which in turn could affect our results of operations.\\n\\nWe purchase some of our components and materials for our products outside of the United States through arrangements with various vendors, and are\\ntherefore exposed to supply chain risks from logistics disruptions. We have experienced delays in obtaining certain necessary components and materials as\\na result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other trade and shipping disruptions and factors beyond our suppliers’ control. International political, social, or\\neconomic  instability  or  as  a  result  of  another  international  pandemic  could  cause  future  trade  disruptions,  impacting  our  supply  chain  and  ability  to\\ncomplete projects in a timely and efficient manner. In addition, certain actions, policies and legislation put forth in various countries where we source\\nmaterials and components out of have created uncertainty with respect to potential tariff impacts on the costs of some of our components and materials as\\nwe go forward. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of materials and components that may be impacted, the proposed\\nrates or rates imposed, and timing of the imposition of such tariffs. Disruptions in the availability of key components or materials may adversely impact our\\nbusiness and operations, and volatility in prices and availability of such items may negatively impact our customer relationships and ability to plan for\\nfuture growth.\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Other events that could disrupt our supply chain include:\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nthe imposition of additional trade legislation or regulations both internationally and domestically;\\n\\nthe imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges on imports and exports, including as a result of the ongoing trade war between the\\nUnited States and China;\\n\\ndisruption of Chinese battery manufacturing due to China’s extremely stringent Covid-Zero policy, causing force majeure to be declared by our\\nbattery manufacturers;\\n\\nbreach of supply contracts by suppliers and vendors;\\n\\nquotas imposed by bilateral trade agreements;\\n\\nforeign currency fluctuations;\\n\\nlogistics and shipping constraints;\\n\\nnatural disasters;\\n\\npublic health issues and epidemic diseases, their effects (including any disruptions they may cause) and/or the perception of their effects;\\n\\ntheft;\\n\\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\\n\\nthe financial instability or bankruptcy of vendors; and\\n\\nsignificant labor disputes, such as dock strikes.\\n\\n•\\nWe cannot predict whether the countries in which our components and materials are sourced, or may be sourced in the future, will be subject to new or\\nadditional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions.\\nTrade restrictions, including new or increased tariffs or quotas, border taxes, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against certain components\\nand materials, as well as labor strikes and work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce or delay the supply of components and materials\\navailable to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\\n\\nSignificant changes in the cost and/or availability of raw materials and components incorporated into our products could adversely affect our business,\\nresults of operations and future prospects.\\n\\nWe  are  subject  to  risk  from  availability  and  fluctuating  market  prices  of  certain  commodity  raw  materials,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  steel,\\naluminum, copper, nickel, iron phosphate, graphite, manganese, lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, and cobalt, that are used in the components from\\nsuppliers, such as lithium-ion batteries, that are used in our energy storage products. Prices and availability of these raw materials may be affected by global\\nsupply and demand balance, inventory levels, speculative activities by market participants, geopolitical uncertainty of any kind and other market factors\\nfrom time to time. There has been sizable increases in the recent months in the cost of certain metals, including lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide,\\nwhich has led to an increase in the price of lithium-ion batteries, Our revenue growth is directly tied to the continued adoption of energy storage products\\nby our customers, which may be affected by commodity raw material price fluctuations, including lithium-ion batteries. As we are not the direct buyer of\\nthese raw materials, we currently do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity risk. Significant price changes or reduced availability for\\nthese raw materials could reduce our operating margins if suppliers increase component prices and we are unable to pass on such increased costs to our\\ncustomers, and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nFailure by our vendors or our component or raw material suppliers to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations\\nmay adversely affect our business.\\n\\nWe do not control our vendors or suppliers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that they follow ethical business practices,\\nsuch as fair wage practices and compliance with environmental, safety, and other local laws. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek\\nalternative manufacturers or suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages, or other disruptions\\nof our operations. Violation of labor or other laws by our manufacturers or suppliers or the divergence of a supplier’s labor or other practices from those\\ngenerally accepted as ethical in the U.S. or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and harm our business.\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##We face supply chain competition and, in some instances, have entered into long-term supply agreements that could result in insufficient inventory and\\nnegatively affect our results of operations.\\n\\nWe have entered into long-term supply agreements with certain suppliers and contract manufacturers of batteries, inverters, and other components of\\nour energy storage products. Some of these supply agreements provide for fixed or inflation-adjusted pricing (including for raw material costs), substantial\\nprepayment obligations, and commitments to continue purchasing certain levels of components in future periods regardless of the level of demand we\\nreceive from customers. If our suppliers provide insufficient inventory at the level of quality required to meet customer requirements, or if our suppliers are\\nunable or unwilling to provide us with the contracted quantities at the contracted prices, as we have limited alternatives for supply in the short term, our\\nresults of operations could be materially and negatively impacted. If our customers do not provide sufficient demand to purchase the levels of inventory we\\nhave committed to purchasing in future periods, our ability to generate revenue or cash flows may be limited.\\n\\nFurther, we face significant specific counterparty risk under long-term supply agreements when dealing with certain suppliers without a long, stable\\nproduction  and  financial  history.  Given  the  uniqueness  of  our  product,  many  of  our  suppliers  do  not  have  a  long  operating  history  and  may  not  have\\nsubstantial  capital  resources.  In  the  event  any  such  supplier  experiences  financial  difficulties,  it  may  be  difficult  or  may  require  substantial  time  and\\nexpense to replace such supplier. We do not know whether we will be able to maintain long-term supply relationships with our critical suppliers, or secure\\nnew long-term supply agreements. Additionally, many of the battery storage products and components of our energy storage products are procured from\\nforeign  suppliers,  which  exposes  us  to  risks  including  unforeseen  increases  in  costs  or  interruptions  in  supply  arising  from  changes  in  applicable\\ninternational trade regulations, such as taxes, tariffs, or quotas. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\\nresults of operations.\\n\\nCertain of our suppliers also supply products and components to other businesses, including businesses engaged in the production of electric vehicles,\\nrenewable energy production, consumer electronics and other industries unrelated to energy storage products. As a relatively low-volume purchaser of\\ncertain of these parts and materials, we may be unable to procure a sufficient supply of the items on favorable terms or at all, in the event that our suppliers\\nfail  to  produce  sufficient  quantities  to  satisfy  the  demands  of  all  of  their  customers,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial\\ncondition, and results of operations.\\n\\nWe also face risks resulting from supplier concentration and limited supplier capacity. We rely on a very small number of suppliers of energy storage\\nsystems and component parts. If any of our suppliers was unable or unwilling to provide us with contracted quantities in a timely manner at prices, quality\\nlevels  and  volumes  acceptable  to  us,  we  would  have  very  limited  alternatives  for  supply,  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  contract  for  and  receive  suitable\\nalternative supply in a timely manner for our customers, or at all. Such an event may impair our ability to meet scheduled deliveries of our products to\\ncustomers, which may cause our customers to cancel orders and subject us to liability, and may materially adversely affect our customer relationships,\\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers\\nto obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms. Additionally, some of our suppliers supply systems and components to other businesses,\\nincluding businesses engaged in the production of consumer electronics and other industries unrelated to energy storage systems. There are also larger\\npurchasers of certain parts and materials that we supply to our customers. As a result, we may be unable to procure a sufficient supply of the items in the\\nevent that our suppliers fail to produce sufficient quantities to satisfy the demands of all of their customers. Any of these occurrences could materially\\nadversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nA loss of one or more of our significant customers, including but not limited to AES and Siemens, their inability to perform under their contracts, or\\ntheir default in payment could harm our business and negatively impact revenue, results of operations, and cash flow.\\n\\nWe are dependent on a relatively small number of customers for our sales, and a small number of customers have historically accounted for a material\\nportion  of  our  revenue.  The  loss  of  any  one  of  the  Company’s  significant  customers,  their  inability  to  perform  under  their  contracts,  their  default  in\\npayment, a significant dispute with one of these customers, a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of any of these\\ncustomers, or any other event significantly negatively impacting the contractual relationship with one of these customers could have a materially adverse\\neffect on the revenues and cash flows of the Company. For the near future, we may continue to derive a significant portion of our net sales from a small\\nnumber of customers. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, our top five customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 77% of our\\nannual  revenue.  Accordingly,  loss  of  a  significant  customer  or  a  significant  reduction  in  pricing  or  order  volume  from  a  significant  customer  could\\nmaterially reduce net sales and operating results in any reporting period.\\n\\nWe face competition for our product and service offerings from a number of established and new competitors, and if we are unable to attract new\\ncustomers and retain existing customers, our revenue growth may be adversely affected. .\\n\\nWe operate in an increasingly competitive business environment and face competition for customers with other energy storage providers. To increase\\n\\nour revenue, our business strategy depends on our ability to attract new customers and retain existing\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##customers. We face competition from other energy storage and digital application providers in the recruitment of potential customers and some of our\\ncompetitors have financial, production, marketing and other resources that are significantly greater than ours. Consolidation by industry participants could\\nfurther  increase  their  resources  and  result  in  competitors  with  expanded  market  share,  larger  customer  bases,  greater  diversified  product  and  service\\nofferings and greater technological and marketing expertise, which may allow them to compete more effectively against us. Moreover, our competitors may\\ndevelop products that are superior to our products (on a price-to-value basis or otherwise) or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or regulatory\\nregimes implemented across the globe. If we are unable to convince potential customers of the benefits of our services, effectively differentiate our product\\nand service offerings from our competitors, or if potential or existing customers prefer the product and service offerings of one of our competitors, we may\\nnot be able to effectively implement this aspect of our growth strategy. Additionally, a significant portion of our annual sales were direct sales to AES or a\\nresult of our Siemens sales relationship. If we fail to maintain those relationships, or if AES or Siemens decide to reduce their energy storage activities in\\nthe  future,  it  could  impact  our  sales  and  our  growth  would  be  even  more  reliant  on  our  ability  to  recruit  new  customers.  Our  inability  to  recruit  new\\ncustomers and retain existing customers would harm our ability to execute our growth strategy and may have a material adverse effect on our business\\noperations and financial position.\\n\\nIf we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively and expansion of our business and operations, we may be unable to execute our business\\nplan, maintain high levels of customer service, or adequately address competitive challenges.\\n\\nWe have experienced significant growth in recent periods. We intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new market\\nsegments. This growth has placed, and any future growth may place, a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial infrastructure. Our\\nmanagement will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers, suppliers, channel partners, and other third parties and attract\\nnew customers and suppliers, as well as manage multiple geographic locations. Our current and planned operations, personnel, IT, and other systems and\\nprocedures might be inadequate to support our future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investment and improvements in our\\ninfrastructure. Our success and ability to further scale our business will depend, in part, on our ability to manage these changes in a cost-effective and\\nefficient manner. If we cannot manage our growth, we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies, or respond\\nappropriately  and  quickly  to  competitive  pressures,  this  could  also  result  in  declines  in  product  quality  and  customer  satisfaction,  increased  costs,\\ndifficulties in introducing new offerings, or other operational difficulties. Any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business and\\nreputation.\\n\\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\\n\\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand recognition is critical to our relationships with customers. The promotion of our\\nbrand may require us to make substantial investments, and we anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, these marketing initiatives\\nmay become increasingly difficult and expensive. Our marketing activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue, and to the extent that these\\nactivities  yield  increased  revenue,  the  increased  revenue  may  not  offset  the  expenses  we  incur  as  part  of  any  marketing  initiatives,  and  our  results  of\\noperations could be harmed. In addition, any factor that diminishes our reputation or that of our management, including failing to meet the expectations of\\nor provide quality products and services to our customers, or any adverse publicity or litigation, could make it substantially more difficult for us to attract\\nnew customers. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition, our business may not grow, and we could lose our\\nrelationships with customers, which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\\n\\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties.\\n\\nWe  rely  on  third-party  general  contractors  to  install  energy  storage  products  at  our  customers’  sites.  We  currently  work  with  a  limited  number  of\\ngeneral contractors, which has impacted and may continue to impact our ability to facilitate customer installations as planned. Our work with contractors or\\ntheir subcontractors may have the effect of us being required to comply with additional rules (including rules unique to our customers), working conditions,\\nsite remediation, and other union requirements, which can add costs and complexity to an installation project. The timeliness, thoroughness, and quality of\\nthe installation-related services performed by our general contractors and their subcontractors in the past have not always met our expectations or standards\\nand  in  the  future  may  not  meet  our  expectations  and  standards,  and  it  may  be  difficult  to  find  and  train  third-party  general  contractors  that  meet  our\\nstandards at a competitive cost.\\n\\nIf we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, including members of the senior management team, in order to execute our business\\nstrategy and growth plan, our business and ability to compete may be adversely affected.\\n\\nCompetition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining\\nemployees  with  appropriate  qualifications.  We  may  face  high  turnover,  requiring  us  to  expend  time  and  resources  to  source,  train  and  integrate  new\\nemployees. The challenging markets in which we compete for talent may also require us to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and\\nretain employees. In addition, a significant portion of our compensation to our key employees is in the form of stock related grants. A prolonged depression\\nin our stock price could make it difficult for us to retain\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##our key and other employees and recruit additional qualified personnel and we may have to pay additional compensation to employees to incentivize them\\nto join or stay with us. Further, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater financial resources than we have. If\\nwe hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or the Company has breached\\ncertain legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current\\npersonnel, our business and future growth prospects and ability to compete could be adversely impacted.\\n\\nMoreover, our success depends largely upon the continued services of our senior management team. We rely on our leadership team in the areas of\\nsales and operations, information technology and security, marketing, and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in\\nour executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. Our executive officers are not\\nsubject to any restrictions that would require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment\\nwith  us  at  any  time.  The  loss  of  one  or  more  of  the  members  of  our  senior  management  team,  could  harm  our  business.  Changes  in  our  executive\\nmanagement team may also cause disruptions in, and harm to, our business.\\n\\nOur  products,  including  components  thereof,  and  technology  could  have  undetected  defects,  errors,  or  bugs  in  hardware  or  software  which  could\\nreduce market adoption, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and/or expose us to product liability and other legal claims that\\ncould materially and adversely affect our business.\\n\\nThe  energy  storage  products  we  develop  are  complex  energy  solutions.  Our  energy  storage  products  and  software  have  contained  design  and\\nmanufacturing-related  defects  and  errors  and  may  in  the  future  contain  undetected  defects  or  errors.  We  do  not  manufacture  the  batteries  or  other\\ncomponents  of  the  energy  storage  products  and  rely  on  our  component  OEM  suppliers  and  contract  manufacturers  to  control  the  quality  of  such\\ncomponents. We provide installation, construction and commissioning services for our customers that purchase our products. In the past, we have from\\ntime to time discovered latent defects in energy storage products and the components thereof and have experienced defects in workmanship and in the\\nfuture we may face such defects in our products or in workmanship. Although we have implemented various quality initiatives to help prevent defects and\\nissues, there is no perfect component. So although we are working towards minimizing the defects, defects may still occur in the future that may result in\\nsignificant expenses or disruptions of our operations. We are continuing to evolve the features and functionality of our products and technology platform\\nthrough  updates  and  enhancements,  and  as  we  do,  we  may  introduce  additional  defects  or  errors  that  may  not  be  detected  until  after  deployment  to\\ncustomers through our hardware.\\n\\nSince we do not manufacture certain components of our energy storage products, our ability to seek recourse for liabilities and recover costs from our\\ncomponent OEM suppliers and contract manufacturers depends on our contractual rights as well as the financial condition and integrity of such component\\nOEM suppliers and contract manufacturers. Furthermore,  our  component  OEM  suppliers  and  contract  manufacturers  may  be  unable  or  not  required  to\\ncorrect manufacturing defects or other failures of such components of our energy storage products in a manner satisfactory to our customers, which could\\nadversely  affect  customer  satisfaction,  market  acceptance,  and  our  business  reputation.  On  rare  occasions,  lithium-ion  batteries  can  rapidly  release  the\\nenergy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion batteries. This faulty result could\\nsubject us to lawsuits, product recalls, or redesign efforts, all of which would be time consuming and expensive. For example, in April 2019, the McMicken\\nenergy  storage  facility  in  Arizona  experienced  a  thermal  event  and  subsequent  explosion,  injuring  several  first  responders  and  making  the  facility\\ninoperable. The facility was built prior to the creation of Fluence and was under a maintenance contract with Fluence. The response and investigation\\nrequired significant expense and the devotion of significant management time. Also, negative public perception regarding the suitability of lithium-ion\\nbatteries for energy applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion batteries, such as a plant, vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not\\ninvolve hardware provided by us, could adversely affect our business and reputation.\\n\\nWe may be subject to legal claims that our hardware and software-enabled services have malfunctioned and persons were injured or purported to be\\ninjured. Any insurance that we carry may not be sufficient or it may not apply to all situations. In addition, our customers could be subjected to claims as a\\nresult  of  such  incidents  and  may  bring  legal  claims  against  us  to  attempt  to  hold  us  liable.  Any  of  these  events  could  adversely  affect  our  brand,\\nrelationships with customers, operating results, or financial condition. For example, on September 4, 2021, a 300 MW energy storage facility owned by one\\nof our customers experienced an overheating event. Fluence served as the energy storage technology provider and designed and installed portions of the\\nfacility, which was completed earlier in fiscal year 2021. No injuries were reported from the incident. Our customer released initial findings in the second\\nfiscal quarter of 2022 on what it contends is the root cause of the incident. The facility was taken offline as teams from Fluence, our customer, and the\\nbattery designer/manufacturer investigated the incident. At this time, Fluence cannot comment on or accept the customer’s stated findings. The customer’s\\nstated findings, if ultimately confirmed and proven, could relate to certain scopes of work for which Fluence or its subcontractors could be responsible. The\\ncustomer’s stated findings, however, could also relate to certain scopes of work for which other parties were responsible and/or relate to other causes,\\nincluding the design and installation of portions of the facility over which Fluence did not have responsibility or control. The customer has alleged that\\nFluence is liable for the incident but has not yet demanded a specific amount of compensation nor alleged a particular level of responsibility . Fluence has\\ndenied liability. No formal legal proceedings have been commenced, but it is reasonably possible that litigation may result from this\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##matter if a resolution cannot be achieved. Any such dispute would also likely include claims by Fluence and counterclaims by the customer relating to\\ndisputed costs arising from the original design and construction of the facility. The customer announced in July of 2022 that a large portion of the facility\\nwas back online. We are currently not able to estimate the impact, if any, that this incident may have on our financial results. To date, we do not believe that\\nthis incident has impacted the market’s adoption of our products.\\n\\nIn addition, Fluence Mosaic generates artificial intelligence-enabled bid recommendations for utility-scale storage and renewable generation assets,\\nenabling customers to optimize asset trading in wholesale electricity markets. While we are generally not regulated as a utility or a broker-dealer, customers\\nof  Fluence  Mosaic  are  regulated  market  participants.  We  could  experience  scrutiny  from  regulators  on  the  provision  of  Fluence  Mosaic  bid\\nrecommendations to our customers and use of such application and the related technologies by our customers. Fluence Nispera, which optimizes renewable\\nasset performance with real-time monitoring, automated reporting, and AI-powered analytics, integrates asset data with intelligent machine learning models\\nand visualization tools. Both of these digital applications could experience a software anomaly, that could result in an unexpected, material adverse event\\nfor our customer, therefore damaging our reputation and business.\\n\\nAny defects or errors in product or services offerings, or the perception of such defects or errors, or other performance problems could result in any of\\n\\nthe following, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations:\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nexpenditure of significant financial and product development resources, including recalls, in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around\\nerrors or defects;\\n\\nsignificant re-engineering costs;\\n\\nloss of existing or potential customers or partners;\\n\\ninterruptions or delays in sales;\\n\\ndelayed or lost revenue;\\n\\ndelay or failure to attain market acceptance;\\n\\ndelay in the development or release of new functionality or improvements;\\n\\nnegative publicity and reputational harm;\\n\\nsales credits or refunds;\\n\\nsecurity vulnerabilities, data breaches, and exposure of confidential or proprietary information;\\n\\ndiversion of development and customer service resources;\\n\\nbreach of warranty claims;\\n\\nthe expense and risk of litigation.\\n\\nlegal claims and regulatory actions under applicable laws, rules, and regulations; and\\n\\n•\\n•\\nAlthough  we  have  contractual  protections,  including  warranty  disclaimers  and  limitation  of  liability  provisions,  in  many  of  our  agreements  with\\ncustomers, resellers, and other business partners, such protections may not be uniformly implemented in all contracts and, where implemented, may not\\nfully  or  effectively  protect  from  claims  by  customers,  resellers,  business  partners  or  other  third  parties.  Any  insurance  coverage  or  indemnification\\nobligations of suppliers may not adequately cover all such claims or cover only a portion of such claims. A successful product liability, warranty, or other\\nsimilar  claim  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  operating  results.  In  addition,  even  claims  that  ultimately  are\\nunsuccessful could result in expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources, and cause reputational harm.\\n\\nCompromises, interruptions, or shutdowns of our systems, including those managed by third parties, whether intentional or inadvertent, could lead to\\ndelays in our business operations and, if significant or extreme, affect our results of operations.\\n\\nFrom  time  to  time,  our  systems  require  modifications  and  updates,  including  by  adding  new  hardware,  software,  and  applications;  maintaining,\\nupdating,  or  replacing  legacy  programs;  and  integrating  new  service  providers  and  adding  enhanced  or  new  functionality.  Although  we  are  actively\\nselecting systems and vendors and implementing procedures to enable us to maintain the integrity of our systems when we modify them, there are inherent\\nrisks associated with modifying or replacing systems, and with new or changed relationships, including accurately capturing and maintaining data, realizing\\nthe expected benefit of the change, and managing the potential disruption of the operation of the systems as the changes are implemented. Potential issues\\nassociated with implementation of\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##these technology initiatives could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business\\ndepends upon our information technology systems. The failure of our information technology systems and the third-party systems we rely on to perform as\\ndesigned, or our failure to implement and operate them effectively, could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby have a material adverse\\neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\\n\\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our operating results.\\n\\nThe  Company  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  enters  into  projects  globally,  which  are  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  such  as  the  Euro,  the\\nPound,  and  the  Australian  Dollar,  and  is  therefore  subject  to  fluctuations  due  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  In  particular,  current\\ngeopolitical instability and fiscal and monetary policies have caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in the currency exchange rates, and\\nsuch volatility may continue for the foreseeable future. If our exposure to currency fluctuations increases and we are not able to successfully hedge against\\nall the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our operating results could be adversely affected. Furthermore,  such  currency  fluctuations  may  also\\nadversely impact our ability to accurately predict our future financial results. Therefore, from time to time, we seek to manage our exposure to foreign\\ncurrency risk relating to these cash flow projects through entering into different types of hedging arrangements designed to reduce such risk exposure.\\nHowever, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will successfully reduce our risk exposure. In addition, there may be unforeseen events\\naffecting our business that could lead us to be long in positions that we did not anticipate when such hedging transactions were put into place which in turn\\ncould lead to adverse effects on our financial position.\\n\\nOur current and planned foreign operations expose us to additional business, financial, regulatory, geopolitical, and other related risks which may\\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\\n\\nWe sell our products and have operations in a number of different countries, including, but not limited to, the United States, the United Kingdom,\\nmultiple European Union countries, Chile, Australia, Taiwan, India and the Philippines. We have in the past, and may in the future, evaluate and take\\nadvantage of opportunities to expand into new geographic markets and introduce new product offerings and services that are a natural extension of our\\nexisting business internationally. We also may from time to time engage in acquisitions of businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our\\nmarket position, enable us to enter attractive markets, expand our technological capabilities, or provide synergy opportunities in those geographic markets\\nwe currently are in or in other geographic markets that we have not yet penetrated.\\n\\nOur international operations and the markets in which we operate or that we may operate in in the future expose us to risks, including:\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\ncompliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws, regulations and permitting processes, including trade, labor,\\nenvironmental, banking, employment, privacy and data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU Data Privacy Directive, as well as tariffs,\\nexport quotas, customs duties and other trade restrictions;\\n\\ncompliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended;\\n\\ncompliance with potentially conflicting and changing laws of taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business and applicable U.S. tax laws as they\\nrelate to international operations, the complexity and adverse consequences of such tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences due to\\nchanges in such tax laws;\\n limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\\n\\ngeopolitical or economic conditions or uncertainty, which may include war, political instability or unrest, or terrorism (such as the current armed\\nconflict between Ukraine and Russia);\\n restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\\n\\ndifferent customer and sales practices including longer sales cycles, warranty expectations, and product return policies;\\n\\ncost, performance, and compatibility requirements;\\n\\n•\\n•\\nThese conditions listed above are generally beyond our ability to control, influence or predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business,\\n\\nfluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and global inflation.\\n\\nfinancial position, results of operations and liquidity.\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Our hardware and software-enabled services involve a lengthy sales and installation cycle, and if we fail to close sales on a regular and timely basis it\\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nOur sales cycle is typically twelve months for our hardware and software-enabled services but can vary considerably, typically between three months\\nto twelve months. In order to make a sale, we must often provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of\\nour hardware and software-enabled services.\\n\\nThe period between initial discussions with a potential customer and the sale of an energy storage product typically depends on a number of factors,\\nincluding  the  potential  customer’s  budget  and  decision  as  to  the  type  of  financing  it  chooses  to  use,  as  well  as  the  arrangement  of  such  financing.\\nProspective customers often undertake a significant evaluation process, which may further extend the sales cycle. This lengthy sales cycle is subject to a\\nnumber of significant risks over which we have little or no control. Because of both the long sales cycle, we may expend significant resources without\\nhaving certainty of generating a sale.\\n\\nThese lengthy sales and installation cycles increase the risk that our customers may fail to satisfy their payment obligations, cancel orders before the\\ncompletion of the transaction, or delay the planned date for installation. Cancellation rates may be impacted by factors outside of our control including an\\ninability to install an energy storage product at the customer’s chosen location because of permitting or other regulatory issues, unanticipated changes in the\\ncost or availability of alternative sources of electricity available to the customer, or other reasons unique to each customer. Our operating expenses are\\nbased on anticipated sales levels, and many of our expenses are fixed. If we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant resources or if we\\nexperience delays or cancellations in the installations process, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n\\nAdditionally, we have long-term, multi-year service contracts with some of our customers. If those contracts are terminated or if we are unable to\\n\\ncontinue to fulfill the obligations under such contracts, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n\\nAmounts included in our pipeline and contracted backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits.\\n\\nInformation about our pipeline and contracted backlog included in this Annual Report is based on numerous assumptions and limitations, calculated\\nusing our internal data that has not been independently verified by third parties and may not provide an accurate indication of our future or expected results.\\nPipeline is monitored by management to understand the growth of our Company and our estimated future revenue related to customer contracts for our\\nbattery-based energy storage products and services. Pipeline and backlog are not prepared or audited in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We cannot guarantee\\nthat our pipeline or contracted backlog will result in actual revenue in the originally anticipated period, if at all. Our customers operate in a relatively new\\nindustry and have based their commitments to us on assumptions about future energy prices, demand levels, regulatory regimes and incentives, among\\nother factors. Further, certain customers may need to obtain financing to fulfill their commitments to us. If the market does not grow as expected, the\\nregulatory  environment  changes,  or  customers  fail  to  obtain  necessary  financial  backing,  customers  may  fail  to  satisfy  their  minimum  purchase\\ncommitments to us and we would fail to realize our contracted backlog. Furthermore, our pipeline or contracted backlog may not generate margins equal to\\nhistorical operating results. We have only recently begun to track our pipeline and contracted backlog on a consistent basis, and as a result, we do not have\\nsignificant experience in determining the level of realization that we will achieve. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result\\nof external market factors and economic or other factors beyond our control. If our pipeline or backlog fails to result in revenue at all or in a timely manner,\\nwe could experience a reduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\\nOperations—Key Operating Metrics” for additional information regarding our pipeline and contracted backlog.\\n\\nWe may experience difficulties in establishing mass manufacturing capacity and estimating potential cost savings and efficiencies from anticipated\\nimprovements to our manufacturing capabilities.\\n\\nWhile our manufacturing output achieved to date is already at commercial scale, it is a fraction of what we expect will be necessary to fully meet the\\ndemand we see in the market for our products. The manufacturing process for our expected full commercial scale is still being refined and improved. There\\nare risks associated with scaling up manufacturing to larger commercial volumes including, among others, technical or other problems with process scale-\\nup, process reproducibility, stability issues, quality consistency, timely availability of raw materials, supply chain delays and bottlenecks, cost overruns, and\\nadequate definitions or qualifications for safety, reliability, and quality. In addition, in connection with our limited operating history and our significant\\ngrowth, we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience incurrence of project costs without proper documentation or adhering to our\\npolicies and procedures. There is no assurance that our manufacturers will be successful in establishing a larger-scale commercial manufacturing process\\nthat achieves our objectives for manufacturing capacity and cost per battery, in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to produce sufficient quantities of\\nproducts on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner, the Company’s commercialization efforts would be impaired which could materially adversely\\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##If our estimates of useful life for our energy storage products and related hardware and software-enabled services are inaccurate or if our component\\nOEM suppliers do not meet service and performance warranties and guarantees, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\\n\\nWe  sell  hardware  products  and  software-enabled  services  to  our  customers.  Our  software-enabled  services  are  essential  to  the  operation  of  these\\nhardware products. Our pricing of services contracts is based upon the value we expect to deliver to our customers, including considerations such as the\\nuseful  life  of  the  energy  storage  product  and  prevailing  electricity  prices.  We  also  provide  warranties  and  guarantees  covering  the  efficiency  and\\nperformance of certain of our products and digital applications. We do not have a long history with a large number of field deployments, and our estimates\\nmay prove to be incorrect. Failure to meet these performance warranties and guarantee levels may require us to refund our service contract payments to the\\ncustomer or require us to make cash payments to the customer based on actual performance, as compared to expected performance.\\n\\nAs part of growing our business, we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions. If we fail to successfully select, execute, or integrate our\\nacquisitions, then our business and operating results could be adversely affected and our stock price could decline.\\n\\nWe continuously evaluate potential acquisitions to add new product lines and technologies, gain new sales channels, or enter into new sales territories.\\nFor example, in 2022, we acquired Fluence Energy AG (formerly known as Nispera AG), a Zurich based provider of artificial intelligence (AI) and in\\n2020,  we  acquired  AMS’  software  and  digital  intelligence  platform,  which  has  become  Fluence  Mosaic.  Acquisitions  involve  numerous  risks  and\\nchallenges, including but not limited to the following:\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nintegrating the companies, assets, systems, products, sales channels, and personnel that we acquire;\\n\\nhigher than anticipated acquisition and integration costs and expenses;\\n\\nreliance on third parties to provide transition services for a period of time after closing to ensure an orderly transition of the business;\\n\\ngrowing or maintaining revenues to justify the purchase price and the increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\\n\\nentering into territories or markets with which we have limited or no prior experience;\\n\\nestablishing or maintaining business relationships with customers, vendors, and suppliers who may be new to us;\\n\\novercoming the employee, customer, vendor, and supplier turnover that may occur as a result of the acquisition;\\n\\ndisruption of, and demands on, our ongoing business as a result of integration activities including diversion of management’s time and attention\\nfrom running the day to day operations of our business;\\n\\nunfavorable tax or accounting treatment;\\n\\ninability to implement uniform standards, disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls over financial reporting, and other procedures and\\npolicies in a timely manner;\\n\\ninability  to  realize  the  anticipated  benefits  of  or  successfully  integrate  with  our  existing  business  the  businesses,  products,  technologies  or\\npersonnel that we acquire; and\\n\\npotential post-closing disputes.\\n\\n•\\nAs part of undertaking an acquisition, we may also significantly revise our capital structure or operational budget, including through issuing common\\nstock that would dilute the ownership percentage of our stockholders, assuming liabilities or debt, utilizing a substantial portion of our cash resources to\\npay for the acquisition, or significantly increasing operating expenses. In addition, our effective tax rate in any particular quarter may also be impacted by\\nacquisitions. Following the closing of an acquisition, we may also have disputes with the seller regarding contractual requirements and covenants, purchase\\nprice  adjustments,  contingent  payments,  or  for  indemnifiable  losses.  Any  such  disputes  may  be  time  consuming  and  distract  management  from  other\\naspects of our business. In addition, if we increase the pace or size of acquisitions, we will have to expend significant management time and effort into the\\ntransactions and integrations, and we may not have the proper human resources bandwidth to ensure successful integrations and accordingly, our business\\ncould be harmed or the benefits of our acquisitions may not be realized.\\n\\nOur  customer  relationships,  business,  financial  results  and  reputation  may  be  adversely  impacted  due  to  events  and  incidents  relating  to  storage,\\ndelivery, installation, operation, maintenance and shutdowns of our energy storage products.\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Our  customer  relationships,  business,  financial  results,  and  reputation  may  be  adversely  impacted  due  to  events  and  incidents  relating  to  storage,\\ndelivery, installation, operation and shutdowns of our energy storage products, including events and incidents outside of our control. We are subject to\\nvarious risks as a result of the size, weight, and sophisticated nature of our energy storage products, including exposure to production, delivery, supply\\nchain, inventory, installation and maintenance issues. Such issues may, and from time to time have, result in financial losses, including losses resulting from\\nour failure to deliver or install our energy storage products on a contractually agreed timeframe, or losses resulting from agreed warranty or indemnity\\nterms.  Furthermore,  issues  and  incidents  involving  our  customers  or  their  facilities  at  which  our  energy  storage  products  are  located,  whether  or  not\\nattributable to our energy storage products, may have an adverse effect on our reputation and customer relationships. Any of these developments could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nActual or threatened health epidemics, pandemics or similar public health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had and could in the future\\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, outlook, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\\n\\nThe global markets in which we operate have been impacted by and continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business has been\\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and in the future could continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 or other health pandemics, epidemics or\\nsimilar public health threats. There continues to be uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic, its ultimate duration, and its impact on U.S. and global\\neconomic activity and consumer behavior. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ground operations at project sites, our manufacturing facilities and\\nour suppliers and vendors have been in the past and could be disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines, shortage of COVID-19 test kits and personal\\nprotection equipment for employees, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, or other travel or health-related\\nrestrictions.  For  example,  our  suppliers  and  vendors  in  Asia  have  been  particularly  impacted  by  business  closures  and  disruptions  to  ports  and  other\\nshipping infrastructure arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of certain variants over the course of the last two years. If our ground operations\\nat  project  sites,  our  manufacturing  facilities  and  our  suppliers  or  vendors  are  so  affected  in  the  future,  our  supply  chain,  manufacturing  and  product\\nshipments will be delayed, which could adversely affect our business, operations, and customer relationships.\\n\\nOverall, our revenue for fiscal year 2022 has been negatively affected by impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as continued delays in\\nshipping energy storage products and components thereof and temporary closures of customer construction sites. Additionally, we saw COVID-19 driven\\nlockdowns in key areas for our battery suppliers, such as China, that resulted in our battery suppliers issuing delay notices to us. Due to the delays from our\\nbattery suppliers, some of our intended projects were delayed, resulting in lower revenue recognition. Additionally, some of our projects that were delayed\\nbecause  of  COVID-19  supply  chain  disruptions  also  incurred  liquidated  damages  payable  to  our  customers  resulting  in  decreased  profitability.  If  this\\ncontinues into fiscal year 2023, we could face adverse effects to our business and results of operations.\\n\\nWe have encountered and could encounter in the future project delays and resulting liquidated damages claims from customers due to impacts on\\nsuppliers, customers, or others. The duration and intensity of these impacts and resulting disruption to our operations is uncertain and continues to evolve.\\nThe extent to which these events may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this\\ntime.  Accordingly,  management  will  continue  to  monitor  the  impact  of  the  global  situation  on  its  financial  condition,  liquidity,  operations,  suppliers,\\nindustry, and workforce.\\n\\nThe scope and duration of the pandemic, including any current or future resurgences, the pace at which government restrictions are lifted or whether\\nadditional actions may be taken to contain the virus, the impact on our customers and suppliers, the speed and extent to which markets recover from the\\ndisruptions caused by the pandemic, and the impact of these factors on our business, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and\\ncannot be predicted with confidence. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein, any of which could have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\\n\\nRisks Related to Our Industry\\n\\nIf renewable energy technologies are not suitable for widespread adoption or sufficient demand for our hardware and software-enabled services does\\nnot develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, our sales may decline, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\\n\\nThe market for renewable, distributed energy generation is emerging and rapidly evolving, and its future success is uncertain. If renewable energy\\ngeneration proves unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment or if demand for our renewable energy hardware and software-enabled services fails\\nto develop as anticipated, we would be unable to achieve expected level of sales and revenue and market share.\\n\\nMany factors may influence the widespread adoption of renewable energy generation and demand for our hardware and software-enabled services,\\nincluding, but not limited to, the cost-effectiveness of renewable energy technologies as compared with conventional and competitive technologies, the\\nperformance and reliability of renewable energy products as compared with conventional and non-\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##renewable products, fluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the viability of conventional and competitive alternative energy sources,\\nincreases  or  decreases  in  the  prices  of  oil,  coal  and  natural  gas,  continued  deregulation  of  the  electric  power  industry  and  broader  energy  industry,\\ngovernmental regulations regarding renewable energy generation, and the availability or effectiveness of government subsidies and incentives.\\n\\nThe growth and profitability of our business is largely dependent upon the continued decline in the overall cost of battery storage. Over the last decade\\nthe cost of battery storage products, particularly lithium-ion based battery storage products, have declined significantly. This lower cost has been driven by\\nadvances in battery technology, maturation of the battery supply chain, the scale of battery production by the leading manufacturers and other factors. The\\ngrowth of our hardware sales and related software-enabled services is dependent upon the continued decrease in the price and efficiency of battery storage\\nproducts of our component OEM suppliers. However, in fiscal year 2022, we saw battery prices increase for the first time and as a result, we had to adopt a\\ndifferent contracting strategy to ensure preservation of margin. If for any reason going forward our component OEM suppliers are unable to continue to\\nreduce the price of their battery storage products, as they have historically done prior to fiscal year 2022, our business and financial condition may be\\nnegatively impacted.\\n\\nIf the estimates and assumptions we use to determine the size of our total addressable market are inaccurate, our future growth rate may be affected,\\nand the potential growth of our business may be limited.\\n\\nMarket  estimates  and  growth  forecasts  are  subject  to  significant  uncertainty  and  are  based  on  assumptions  and  estimates  that  may  prove  to  be\\ninaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at\\nall. The assumptions relating to our market opportunity include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) according to BloombergNEF, global energy storage\\ncapacity grew 63% per annum between 2015 and 2020 and is expected to grow at a further 21% compound annual growth rate through 2030 based on the\\nEnergy  Storage  Market  Outlook  dated  October  2022  ;  (ii)  declines  in  lithium-ion  battery  costs  and  in  the  cost  of  renewable  generation;  (iii)  growing\\ndemand for renewable energy; and (iv) increased complexity of the electrical grid. Our market opportunity is also based on the assumption that our existing\\nand future offerings will be more attractive to our customers and potential customers than competing products and services. If these assumptions prove\\ninaccurate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. For more information regarding our estimates of market\\nopportunity and the forecasts of market growth included herein, see the section entitled “Business.”\\n\\nExisting electric utility industry policies and regulations, and any subsequent changes, may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the\\npurchase and use of energy storage products that may significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete.\\n\\nFederal, state, local, and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the broader electric utility industry, as well as internal policies and\\nregulations promulgated by electric utilities and organized electric markets with respect to fees, practices, and rate design, can influence the market for\\nenergy storage products and services. These regulations and policies often affect electricity pricing and the interconnection of generation facilities, and can\\nbe subject to frequent modifications by governments, regulatory bodies, utilities, and market operators. For example, changes in fee structures, electricity\\npricing  structures,  and  system  permitting,  interconnection,  and  operating  requirements  can  deter  purchases  of  renewable  energy  products  by  reducing\\nanticipated  revenues  or  increasing  costs  or  regulatory  burdens  for  would-be  system  purchasers.  The  resulting  reductions  in  demand  for  energy  storage\\nproducts could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nA significant recent development in renewable-energy pricing policies in the U.S. occurred on July 16, 2020, when the Federal Energy Regulatory\\nCommission  (“FERC”)  issued  a  final  rule  amending  regulations  that  implement  the  Public  Utility  Regulatory  Policies  Act  (“PURPA”).  Among  other\\nrequirements, PURPA mandates that electric utilities buy the output of certain renewable generators below established capacity thresholds. PURPA also\\nrequires that such sales occur at a utility’s “avoided cost” rate. FERC’s PURPA reforms include modifications (1) to how regulators and electric utilities\\nmay  establish  avoided  cost  rates  for  new  contracts;  (2)  that  reduce  from  20  MW  to  5  MW  the  capacity  threshold  above  which  a  renewable-energy\\nqualifying facility is rebuttably presumed to have nondiscriminatory market access, thereby removing the requirement for utilities to purchase its output;\\n(3) that require regulators to establish criteria for determining when an electric utility incurs a legally enforceable obligation to purchase from a PURPA\\nfacility; and (4) that reduce barriers for third parties to challenge PURPA eligibility. In general, FERC’s PURPA reforms have the potential to reduce prices\\nfor the output from certain new renewable generation projects while also narrowing the scope of PURPA eligibility for new projects. These effects could\\nreduce demand for PURPA-eligible battery energy storage products and could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nChanges in other current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws, regulations, or policies in the U.S., Europe, or other\\njurisdictions in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any changes to\\ngovernment, utility, or electric market regulations or policies that favor electric utilities or other market participants could reduce the competitiveness of\\nbattery energy storage products and cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services and adversely impact our growth.\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##The economic benefit of our energy storage products to our customers includes, among other things, the benefit of reducing such customer’s payments\\nto the local electric utility company. The rates at which electricity is available from a customer’s local electric utility company is subject to change and any\\nchanges  in  such  rates  may  affect  the  relative  benefits  of  our  energy  storage  products.  Further,  the  local  electric  utility  may  impose  “departing  load,”\\n“standby” or other charges on our customers in connection with their acquisition of our energy storage products, the amounts of which are outside of our\\ncontrol and which may have a material impact on the economic benefit of our energy storage products to our customers. Changes in the rates offered by\\nlocal electric utilities and/or in the applicability or amounts of charges and other fees imposed by such utilities on customers acquiring our energy storage\\nproducts could adversely affect the demand for our energy storage products.\\n\\nAn increase in interest rates or a reduction in the availability of tax equity or project debt capital in the global financial markets could make it difficult\\nfor end customers to finance the cost of a renewable energy storage system and could reduce the demand for our products.\\n\\nMany end users depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase our products and services as a result of the significant\\nup-front costs. Their ability to attract third-party financing depends on many factors that are outside of our control, including the ability of third parties to\\nutilize tax credits and other government incentives, interest rate and/or currency exchange fluctuations, their perceived creditworthiness and the condition\\nof credit markets generally. As a result, an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt or tax equity financing could reduce the\\nnumber of customer projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or their customers to secure the financing necessary to\\nconstruct a renewable energy system on favorable terms, or at all, and thus lower demand for our products, which could limit our growth or reduce our net\\nsales. In addition, we believe that a significant percentage of end-users construct renewable energy storage systems as an investment, funding a significant\\nportion of the initial capital expenditure with financing from third parties. An increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment,\\nincrease equity requirements, or make alternative investments more attractive relative to our products and services and, in each case, could cause these end\\nusers to seek alternative investments.\\n\\nChanges in tax laws or regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\\n\\nChanges in corporate tax rates, tax incentives for renewable energy projects, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our U.S. operations,\\nthe taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under future tax reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our\\ndeferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense, any\\nand all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\\n\\nGovernmental agencies in the jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates do business, as well as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and\\nDevelopment (the “OECD”), have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational business, including issues relating to “base erosion and\\nprofit  shifting,”  where  profits  are  reported  as  earned  for  tax  purposes  in  relatively  low-tax  jurisdictions  or  payments  are  made  between  affiliates  in\\njurisdictions with different tax rates. The OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for\\naddressing  base  erosion  and  profit  shifting,  and  governmental  authorities  from  various  jurisdictions  (including  the  United  States)  continue  to  discuss\\npotential legislation and other reforms, including proposals for global minimum tax rates.\\n\\nAs  we  operate  in  numerous  jurisdictions,  the  application  of  tax  laws  can  be  subject  to  diverging  and  sometimes  conflicting  interpretations  by  tax\\nauthorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance with respect to\\nwhether a permanent establishment exists in a particular jurisdiction, the manner in which an arm’s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes,\\nor with respect to the valuations of intellectual property. For example, if a taxing authority in one country where we operate were to reallocate income from\\nanother country where we operate, and if the taxing authority in the second country did not agree with the reallocation asserted by the first country, then we\\ncould be subject to tax on the same income in both countries, resulting in double taxation. If taxing authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax\\njurisdiction,  subject  our  income  to  double  taxation  or  assess  interest  and  penalties,  our  tax  liabilities  could  increase,  which  could  adversely  affect  our\\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nDue to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining\\nto recent tax reforms in the United States), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our\\nintercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective\\ntax rate and income tax assets and liabilities may be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected, and the resulting impacts may vary\\nsubstantially from period to period.\\n\\nIn particular, in the United States, there have been multiple significant changes recently proposed (including the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act\\nof 2022 signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022) to the taxation of business entities, including, among other things, an increase in the U.S.\\nfederal corporate income tax rate, a transition to graduated rates, an increase in the tax rate\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##applicable to global intangible low-taxed income and elimination of certain exemptions, and various other changes to the U.S. international tax regime.\\nWhile we are analyzing the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, we are currently unable to predict whether other proposed changes will occur and, if so,\\nwhen they would be effective or the ultimate impact on us or our business. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us or our business,\\nthese changes may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nIn addition, the amounts of taxes we pay are subject to current or future audits by taxing authorities in the United States and all other jurisdictions in\\nwhich we operate. If audits result in additional payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments\\nto our tax liabilities, and our financial statements could be adversely affected.\\n\\nWe  may  incur  obligations,  liabilities,  or  costs  under  environmental,  health,  and  safety  laws,  which  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business,\\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nWe are required to comply with national, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment, health, and safety.\\nWe may incur expenses, or be subject to liability, related to the transportation, storage, or disposal of lithium-ion batteries, or other materials used in our\\nproducts. Adoption of more stringent laws and regulations in the future could require us to incur substantial costs to come into compliance with these laws\\nand regulations. In addition, violations of, or liabilities under, these laws and regulations may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities\\nor  in  our  being  subject  to  adverse  publicity,  substantial  fines,  penalties,  criminal  proceedings,  third-party  property  damage  or  personal  injury  claims,\\ncleanup costs, or other costs. Liability under these laws and regulations can be imposed on a joint and several basis and without regard to fault or the\\nlegality  of  the  activities  giving  rise  to  the  claim.  In  addition,  future  developments  such  as  more  aggressive  enforcement  policies  or  the  discovery  of\\npresently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\\noperations.\\n\\nThe reduction, elimination, or expiration of government incentives for, or regulations mandating the use of, renewable energy could reduce demand\\nfor energy storage products and harm our business.\\n\\nFederal, state, local, and foreign government bodies provide incentives to owners, end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of\\nrenewable energy products to promote renewable electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives. The range and duration of\\nthese incentives varies widely by jurisdiction. Our customers typically use our products for grid-connected applications wherein power is sold under a\\npower  purchase  agreement  or  into  an  organized  electric  market.  The  reduction,  elimination,  or  expiration  of  government  incentives  for  grid-connected\\nelectricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of our offerings relative to conventional renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the\\ngrowth of our industry and our business. These subsidies and incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be\\nreduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase or as a result of legal challenges, the adoption of new statutes or regulations, or the\\npassage of time. These reductions or terminations may occur without warning. The reduction, elimination or expiration of such incentives therefore could\\nharm our business and cash flows.\\n\\nIn August 2022, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), which includes a number of government incentives that\\nsupport  the  adoption  of  energy  storage  products  and  services  and  are  anticipated  to  benefit  the  Company  and  its  operations.  Forthcoming  guidance  to\\nimplement the IRA from the U.S. Department of Treasury and other federal administrative agencies could be drafted in such manner that would not be as\\nanticipated and may be adverse to the Company’s interests.\\n\\nRevenue from any projects we support may be adversely affected if there is a decline in public acceptance or support of renewable energy, or regulatory\\nagencies, local communities, or other third parties delay, prevent, or increase the cost of constructing and operating customer projects.\\n\\nCertain persons, associations and groups could oppose renewable energy projects in general or our customers’ projects specifically, citing, for example,\\nmisuse of water resources, landscape degradation, land use, food scarcity or price increase, and harm to the environment. Moreover, regulation may restrict\\nthe development of renewable energy plants in certain areas. In order to develop a renewable energy project, our customers are typically required to obtain,\\namong other things, environmental impact permits or other authorizations and building permits, which in turn require environmental impact studies to be\\nundertaken and public hearings and comment periods to be held during which any person, association, or group may oppose a project. Any such opposition\\nmay be taken into account by government officials responsible for granting the relevant permits, which could result in the permits being delayed or not\\nbeing granted or being granted solely on the condition that our customers carry out certain corrective measures to the proposed project.\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Severe weather events, including the effects of climate change, are inherently unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our financial\\nresults and financial condition.\\n\\nOur business, including our customers and suppliers, may be exposed to severe weather events and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, tsunamis,\\ntropical storms (including hurricanes), earthquakes, windstorms, hailstorms, severe thunderstorms, wildfires, and other fires, which could cause operating\\nresults to vary significantly from one period to the next. We may incur losses in our business in excess of: (1) those experienced in prior years, (2) the\\naverage expected level used in pricing, or (3) current insurance coverage limits. The incidence and severity of severe weather conditions and other natural\\ndisasters are inherently unpredictable. Climate change may affect the occurrence of certain natural events, such as an increase in the frequency or severity\\nof wind and thunderstorm events, and tornado or hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere; more frequent wildfires and subsequent\\nlandslides in certain geographies; higher incidence of deluge flooding; and the potential for an increase in severity of the hurricane events due to higher sea\\nsurface temperatures. Additionally, climate change may adversely impact the demand, price, and availability of insurance. Due to significant variability\\nassociated with future changing climate conditions, we are unable to predict the impact climate change will have on our business.\\n\\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Liquidity\\n\\nOur revolving credit facility imposes certain restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our business and make payments on our indebtedness.\\n\\nWe entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement for a $190.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) on November 1, 2021. On June\\n30, 2022, we increased the revolving commitment available under the Revolver by $10.0 million to an aggregate of $200.0 million. The Revolver contains\\ncovenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness; incur liens; sell, transfer, or dispose of property and assets; invest;\\nmake dividends or distributions or other restricted payments and engage in affiliate transactions. In addition, we are required to maintain (i) minimum\\nliquidity and gross revenue requirements, in each case, until consolidated EBITDA reaches a certain specified threshold and we make an election, and (ii)\\nthereafter, a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\nResults of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Revolving Credit Facility” for further discussion of the Revolver. The Revolver limits our ability\\nto make certain payments, including dividends or distributions on Fluence Energy, LLC’s equity and other restricted payments, provided, however, that\\npayments in respect of certain tax distributions under the Fluence Energy LLC Agreement and certain payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are\\npermitted.  See  “Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations—Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources—Tax\\nReceivable  Agreement”  for  further  discussion  of  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement.  These  restrictions  may  restrict  our  current  and  future  operations,\\nparticularly our ability to respond to certain changes in our business or industry or take future actions.\\n\\nOur ability to meet these restrictive covenants can be impacted by events beyond our control and we may be unable to do so. Our Revolver and related\\nsecurity agreements provides that our breach or failure to satisfy certain covenants constitutes an event of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of\\ndefault, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under its debt agreements to be immediately due and payable. In addition, our lenders, to\\nwhom we granted a security interest in substantially all of our assets, would have the right to proceed against such assets we provided as collateral pursuant\\nto the Revolver and related security agreement. If the debt under our Revolver was to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to\\nsell sufficient collateral to repay it, which would have an immediate adverse effect on our business and operating results. This could potentially cause us to\\ncease operations and result in a complete loss of your investment in our Class A common stock.\\n\\nMoreover, the Revolver requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to interest payments, thereby reducing the availability of\\ncash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic,\\nindustry, or competitive developments or conditions; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in\\nwhich we operate or in pursuing our strategic objectives.\\n\\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on acceptable\\nterms or at all.\\n\\nWe  believe  that  our  current  cash  and  cash  equivalents  together  with  our  expected  cash  from  operations,  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  our  projected\\noperating requirements for the foreseeable future. However, continued expansion of our business will be expensive, and we may seek additional funds from\\npublic and private stock offerings, borrowings under our existing or new credit facilities or other sources which we may not be able to maintain or obtain\\non acceptable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\\n\\n• market acceptance of our offerings;\\n•\\n\\nthe revenue generated by sales of our offerings;\\n\\n32\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\nthe costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts;\\nthe expenses we incur in manufacturing and selling our products;\\nthe costs of developing and commercializing new products or technologies;\\nthe cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights;\\nthe cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property rights;\\nthe cost of enforcing or defending against non-competition claims;\\nthe number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\\nthe costs associated with our planned international expansion; and\\nunanticipated general and administrative expenses.\\n\\nAs a result of these factors, we may seek to raise additional capital to, among others:\\n• maintain appropriate product inventory levels;\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\ncontinue our research and development and protect our intellectual property rights;\\ndefend claims, in litigation or otherwise;\\nexpand our geographic reach;\\ncommercialize our new products; and\\nacquire companies and license products or intellectual property.\\n\\nSuch capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional capital, our existing\\nstockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing\\nstockholders. In addition, if we raise additional capital through collaboration, licensing, or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish\\nvaluable rights to our products, potential products, or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Historically, we have\\nrelied on parent corporate guarantees from our affiliates to support project sales. If we are unable to rely on our standalone credit quality or utilize such\\nparent corporate guarantees going forward, it may impact our ability to sell products or establish supplier relationships going forward. If we cannot raise\\ncapital on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or\\nrespond to competitive pressures, changes in our supplier relationships, or unanticipated customer requirements. Any of these events could adversely affect\\nour ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and\\nfinancial condition.\\n\\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology\\n\\nIf  we  are  unable  to  obtain,  maintain  and  enforce  intellectual  property  protection  for  our  technology  or  if  the  scope  of  our  intellectual  property\\nprotection  is  not  sufficiently  broad,  others  may  be  able  to  develop  and  commercialize  technology  substantially  similar  to  ours,  and  our  ability  to\\nsuccessfully commercialize our technology may be adversely affected.\\n\\nOur  business  depends  on  internally  developed  technology,  including  hardware,  software,  databases,  confidential  information  and  know-how,  the\\nprotection  of  which  is  crucial  to  the  success  of  our  business.  We  rely  on  a  combination  of  patent,  trademark,  trade-secret,  and  copyright  laws  and\\nconfidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights in our internally developed technology. We may, over time,\\nincrease our investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional trademark, patent, and other intellectual property filings that could be\\nexpensive and time-consuming. Effective patent protection is expensive to develop and maintain and while it is generally less costly to obtain trademark\\nand copyright protection, the aggregate costs of maintaining a portfolio of patents and registered copyrights and trademarks can be substantial, both in\\nterms of initial and ongoing prosecution and maintenance requirements and the costs of enforcing and defending our rights. These measures, however, may\\nnot be sufficient to offer us meaningful protection. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and other rights, our competitive position and our\\nbusiness could be harmed, as third parties may be able to commercialize and use technologies and software products that are substantially the same as ours\\nwithout incurring the development and licensing costs that we have incurred. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged,\\ninvalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated, and our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized\\nmanner to third parties. Further, our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to\\nprovide us with competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain offerings, or other competitive harm.\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. From time to time, we seek to analyze our competitors’ services, and\\nmay in the future seek to enforce our rights against potential infringement. However, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may\\nnot  be  adequate  to  prevent  infringement  or  misappropriation  of  our  intellectual  property.  We  may  not  be  able  to  detect  unauthorized  use  of,  or  take\\nappropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Any inability to meaningfully protect our intellectual property rights could result in harm to\\nour  ability  to  compete  and  reduce  demand  for  our  technology.  Moreover,  our  failure  to  develop  and  properly  manage  new  intellectual  property  could\\nadversely affect our market positions and business opportunities. Also, some of our services rely on technologies and software developed by or licensed\\nfrom third parties, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable\\nterms or at all.\\n\\nUncertainty may result from changes in intellectual property laws as a result of new legislation and from new interpretations of intellectual property\\nlaws by applicable courts and agencies. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to obtain and maintain the intellectual property rights necessary\\nto provide us with a competitive advantage. Our failure to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights could therefore have a material\\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nWe may be sued by third parties for infringement, misappropriation, dilution, or other violation of their intellectual property or proprietary rights.\\n\\nInternet, advertising, and e-commerce companies frequently are subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, dilution,\\nor other violations of intellectual property rights. Some internet, advertising, and e-commerce companies, including some of our competitors, as well as\\nnon-practicing entities, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, which they may use to assert claims against us.\\n\\nThird parties may in the future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, diluted, or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. For\\ninstance, the use of our technology to provide our offerings could be challenged by claims that such use infringes, dilutes, misappropriates, or otherwise\\nviolates the intellectual property rights of a third party. In addition, we may in the future be exposed to claims that content published or made available\\nthrough our apps or websites violates third-party intellectual property rights.\\n\\nAs we face increasing competition and as a public company, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. Such claims and\\nlitigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property rights holders who have no relevant product revenue, and therefore\\nour own pending patents and other intellectual property rights may provide little or no deterrence to these rights holders in bringing intellectual property\\nrights claims against us. Third parties may hold intellectual property rights that cover significant aspects of our technologies, content, branding, or business\\nmethods, and we cannot assure that we are not infringing or violating, and have not violated or infringed, any third-party intellectual property rights or that\\nwe will not be held to have done so or be accused of doing so in the future. We expect that we may receive in the future notices that claim we or our\\npartners, or clients using our solutions and services, have infringed or misappropriated, other parties’ intellectual property rights, particularly as the number\\nof competitors in our market grows and the functionality of applications amongst competitors overlaps.\\n\\nAny claim that we have violated intellectual property or other proprietary rights of third parties, with or without merit, and whether or not it results in\\nlitigation, is settled out of court or is determined in our favor, could be time-consuming and costly to address and resolve, and could divert the time and\\nattention of management and technical personnel from our business. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may result in an injunction and could\\nrequire  us  to  pay  substantial  monetary  damages,  including  treble  damages  and  attorneys’  fees,  if  we  are  found  to  have  willfully  infringed  a  party’s\\nintellectual property rights. Any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to enter into a licensing agreement to continue\\nusing the technology, content, or other intellectual property that is the subject of the claim; restrict or prohibit our use of such technology, content, or other\\nintellectual property; require us to expend significant resources to redesign our technology or solutions; and require us to indemnify third parties. Royalty\\nor licensing agreements, if required or desirable, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may require significant royalty payments and\\nother expenditures. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and expense. There also\\ncan be no assurance that we would be able to develop or license suitable alternative technology, content, or other intellectual property to permit us to\\ncontinue  offering  the  affected  technology,  content,  or  services  to  our  partners  or  clients.  If  we  cannot  develop  or  license  technology  for  any  allegedly\\ninfringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our product or service offerings and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these\\nevents could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected or protectable, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest,\\nand our competitive position may be harmed.\\n\\nThe registered and unregistered trademarks and trade names that we own may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic, lapsed, or\\ndetermined to be infringing on or dilutive of other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in\\norder to build name recognition with potential members, partners, and clients. In\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##addition, third parties may file for registration of trademarks similar or identical to our trademarks, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and\\npossibly leading to market confusion. If they succeed in registering or developing common-law rights in such trademarks, and if we are not successful in\\nchallenging such third-party rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks to develop brand recognition of our technologies, products, or services. In\\naddition,  there  could  be  potential  trademark  infringement  claims  brought  by  owners  of  other  registered  or  unregistered  trademarks  or  trademarks  that\\nincorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks\\nand trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\\noperations and prospects.\\n\\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\\n\\nAs the geographic scope of our business expands, we will need to consider protecting our proprietary technology and content in an increasing number\\nof jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful, and accordingly we may choose not to do so in every location. Filing, prosecuting,\\nmaintaining, defending, and enforcing intellectual property rights on our products, services, and technologies in all countries throughout the world could be\\nprohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United\\nStates. We do not own and have not registered or applied for intellectual property registrations in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may\\nuse our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained protection to develop their own products and services and, further, may export otherwise\\nviolating products and services to territories where we have protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products and\\nservices  may  compete  with  our  solutions  and  services,  and  our  intellectual  property  rights  may  not  be  effective  or  sufficient  to  prevent  them  from\\ncompeting. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect certain proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and\\nmany companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing certain of their proprietary rights outside of the United States. These\\nchallenges can be caused by the absence or inconsistency of the application of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual\\nproperty rights outside of the United States. For instance, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims\\nallowable for business methods. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have on our technologies, products, and services.\\n\\nIn addition, the legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of intellectual property rights to the\\nsame degree at the United States. This could make it difficult for us to stop the misappropriation or other violation of certain of our other intellectual\\nproperty rights. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of protection in such countries.\\nProceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other\\naspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the\\nlaw and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our products, services,\\nand  other  technologies  and  the  enforcement  of  intellectual  property.  Any  of  the  foregoing  could  harm  our  competitive  position,  business,  financial\\ncondition, results of operations, and prospects.\\n\\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or\\nformer employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\\n\\nMany  of  our  employees,  consultants,  and  advisors  are  currently  or  were  previously  employed  at  other  companies  in  our  field,  including  our\\ncompetitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, and advisors do not use the proprietary information or\\nknow-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including\\ntrade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual’s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these\\nclaims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\\nEven if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\\n\\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual\\nproperty to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in\\nfact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the\\nassignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to\\ndetermine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial\\ncondition, results of operations, and prospects.\\n\\n35\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data\\nintegrity of our information technology and other business systems.\\n\\nOur business is highly dependent on maintaining effective information systems as well as the integrity and of the data we use to serve our customers\\nand operate our business. Because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems\\ncould  result  in  data  loss  or  corruption  or  cause  the  information  that  we  collect  to  be  incomplete  or  contain  inaccuracies  that  our  partners  regard  as\\nsignificant. If our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to fraud or other error, or if we, or any of the third-party service providers we engage,\\nwere to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience operational disruptions that may impact our operations and\\nhinder  our  ability  to  provide  services,  establish  appropriate  pricing  for  services,  establish  reserves,  report  financial  results  timely  and  accurately  and\\nmaintain regulatory compliance, among other things. If any such failure of our data integrity were to result in the theft, corruption or other harm to the data\\nof our customers, our ability to retain and attract partners or customers may be harmed.\\n\\nWe must continue to invest in long-term solutions that will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations, enhance the customer experience,\\nact as a differentiator in the market, and protect against cybersecurity risks and threats. Despite our implementation of reasonable security measures, like\\nthose of other companies, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, personnel\\nmisconduct, human error, unauthorized access, physical or electronic security breaches, cyber-attacks (including malicious and destructive code, phishing\\nattacks,  ransomware,  and  denial  of  service  attacks),  and  other  similar  disruptions.  Such  attacks  or  security  breaches  may  be  perpetrated  by  bad  actors\\ninternally  or  externally  (including  computer  hackers,  persons  involved  with  organized  crime,  or  foreign  state  or  foreign  state-supported  actors).\\nCybersecurity threat actors employ a wide variety of methods and techniques that are constantly evolving, increasingly sophisticated, and difficult to detect\\nand successfully defend against. We have experienced such incidents in the past, and any future incidents could expose us to claims, litigation, regulatory\\nor other governmental investigations, administrative fines, and potential liability. Any system failure, accident, or security breach could result in disruptions\\nto our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our trade secrets, customer information, human\\nresources information, or other confidential data, including but not limited to personally identifiable information.\\n\\nAlthough past incidents have not had a material effect on our business operations or financial performance, to the extent that any disruption or security\\nbreach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or customer information, it could cause significant\\ndamage  to  our  reputation,  affect  our  relationships  with  our  customers  and  strategic  partners,  lead  to  claims  against  us  from  governments  and  private\\nplaintiffs, and adversely affect our business. We cannot guarantee that future cyberattacks, if successful, will not have a material effect on our business or\\nfinancial results.\\n\\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of cyber incidents involving certain types of data, including personal\\ndata. These laws may be subject to alterations and revisions, and if we fail to comply with our obligations under such laws in the jurisdictions in which we\\noperate, we could be subject to regulatory action and lawsuits. If an actual or perceived cybersecurity breach of security measures, unauthorized access to\\nour system or the systems of the third-party vendors that we rely upon, or any other cybersecurity threat occurs, we may incur liability, costs, or damages,\\ncontract termination, our reputation may be compromised, our ability to attract new customers could be negatively affected, and our business, financial\\ncondition,  and  results  of  operations  could  be  materially  and  adversely  affected.  Any  compromise  of  our  security  could  also  result  in  a  violation  of\\napplicable domestic and foreign security, privacy or data protection, consumer protection, and other laws, regulatory or other governmental investigations,\\nenforcement actions, and legal and financial exposure, including potential contractual liability. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to\\nprotect against and remediate damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\\n\\nWe utilize open-source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software and solutions.\\n\\nWe use open-source software in our solutions and will use open-source software in the future. Companies that incorporate open-source software into\\ntheir solutions have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the use of open-source software and compliance with open-source license terms. Some\\nlicenses governing the use of open-source software contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we\\ncreate based upon the open-source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open-source license\\nor other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. By the terms of certain open-source licenses, we could be required to release the source\\ncode of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open-source licenses to third parties at no cost, if we combine or\\ndistribute our proprietary software with open-source software in certain manners. Although we monitor our use of open-source software, we cannot assure\\nyou  that  all  open-source  software  is  reviewed  prior  to  use  in  our  solutions,  that  our  developers  have  not  incorporated  open-source  software  into  our\\nsolutions, or that they will not do so in the future. Additionally, the terms of many open-source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted\\nby  U.S.  or  foreign  courts.  There  is  a  risk  that  open-source  software  licenses  could  be  construed  in  a  manner  that  imposes  unanticipated  conditions  or\\nrestrictions on our ability to market or provide our solutions as currently marketed or provided. Companies that incorporate open-source software into their\\nproducts have, in the past, faced claims seeking enforcement of open-source license provisions and claims asserting ownership of open-source software\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##incorporated into their product. If an author or other third party that distributes such open-source software were to allege that we had not complied with the\\nconditions of an open-source license, we could incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations. In the event such claims were\\nsuccessful, we could be subject to significant damages or be enjoined from the distribution of our software. In addition, the terms of open-source software\\nlicenses may require us to provide source code that we develop using such open-source software to others on unfavorable license terms. As a result of our\\ncurrent or future use of open-source software, we may face claims or litigation, be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach\\nof contract, re-engineer our solutions, discontinue making our solutions available in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or\\ntake other remedial action. Any such re-engineering or other remedial efforts could require significant additional research and development resources, and\\nwe may not be able to successfully complete any such re-engineering or other remedial efforts. Further, in addition to risks related to license requirements,\\nuse of certain open-source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide\\nwarranties or controls on the origin of software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a negative\\neffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under license or technology agreements with third parties, we may be required to pay damages, and we could\\nlose license rights that are critical to our business. If we fail to comply with our obligations under license and technology agreements with AES and\\nSiemens, we could lose license rights, including to patents and patent applications, which may prove to be material to our business.\\n\\nWe license certain intellectual property, including patents, technologies, and software from third parties, including AES and Siemens, that is important\\nto our business, and in the future, we may enter into additional agreements that provide us with licenses to valuable intellectual property or technology. If\\nwe fail to comply with any of the obligations under our license agreements, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to\\nterminate the license. Termination by the licensor would cause us to lose valuable rights, and could prevent us from selling our products and services, or\\nadversely impact our ability to commercialize future solutions and services. Our business would suffer if any current or future licenses terminate, if the\\nlicensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, if the licensors fail to enforce licensed patents against infringing third parties, if the licensed intellectual\\nproperty  is  found  to  be  invalid  or  unenforceable,  if  the  licensed  intellectual  property  expires  or  if  we  are  unable  to  enter  into  necessary  licenses  on\\nacceptable terms. In addition, our rights to certain intellectual property, technologies, and software, are licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis. The owners\\nof these non-exclusively licensed technologies are therefore free to license them to third parties, including our competitors, on terms that may be superior to\\nthose offered to us, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been\\nlicensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor’s rights. In\\naddition, the agreements under which we license intellectual property or technology from third parties are generally complex, and certain provisions in such\\nagreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we\\nbelieve to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations\\nunder the relevant agreement. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\\n\\nIf we cannot license rights to use technologies on reasonable terms, we may not be able to commercialize new solutions or services in the future.\\n\\nIn the future, we may identify additional third-party intellectual property we may need to license in order to engage in our business, including to\\ndevelop or commercialize new products or services. However, such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. The licensing or acquisition\\nof third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-\\nparty intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due\\nto their size, capital resources, and greater development or commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may\\nbe unwilling to assign or license rights to us. Even if such licenses are available, we may be required to pay the licensor substantial royalties based on sales\\nof  our  products  and  services.  Such  royalties  are  a  component  of  the  cost  of  our  products  or  services  and  may  affect  the  margins  on  our  products  and\\nservices. In addition, such licenses may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same intellectual property licensed to us. If we\\nare unable to enter into the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all, if any necessary licenses are subsequently terminated, if our licensors fail to\\nabide by the terms of the licenses, if our licensors fail to prevent infringement by third parties, or if the licensed intellectual property rights are found to be\\ninvalid or unenforceable, or if the licensed intellectual property rights expire, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be\\naffected. If licenses to third-party intellectual property rights are or become required for us to engage in our business, the rights may be non-exclusive,\\nwhich could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. Moreover, we could encounter delays and\\nother obstacles in our attempt to develop alternatives. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us\\nfrom  commercializing  solutions  and  services,  which  could  harm  our  competitive  position,  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  and\\nprospects.\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Failure to comply with data privacy and data security laws, regulations and industry standards could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,\\nresults of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences.\\n\\nWe are subject to various laws, related regulations, and industry standards involving data privacy and information security. Such laws and regulations\\nrelating to data privacy and information security are continuously evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may be\\ninterpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As a result, our\\npractices may not have complied in the past or may not comply now or in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations.\\n\\nIn the United States, there are numerous federal and state data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, use, storage,\\nsharing,  transmission,  and  other  processing  of  personal  information,  including  federal  and  state  data  privacy  laws,  data  breach  notification  laws,  and\\nconsumer protection laws. Many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to\\nprivacy, data security, and data breaches. Such legislation includes the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which created new consumer rights,\\nand  imposes  corresponding  obligations  on  covered  businesses,  relating  to  the  access  to,  deletion  of,  and  sharing  of  personal  information  collected  by\\ncovered  businesses,  including  California  residents’  right  to  access  and  delete  their  personal  information,  opt  out  of  certain  sharing  and  sales  of  their\\npersonal information, receive detailed information about how their personal information is used and shared, and may restrict the use of cookies and similar\\ntechnologies  for  advertising  purposes.  The  CCPA  prohibits  discrimination  against  individuals  who  exercise  their  privacy  rights,  and  provides  for  civil\\npenalties for violations enforceable by the California Attorney General as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of\\npersonal information. This private right of action is expected to increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation.\\n\\nAdditionally, a new California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, was recently passed in California and expands the\\nscope of the CCPA. In particular, the CPRA will restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal information that we handle; establish restrictions on\\nthe retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection\\nAgency to implement and enforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines. The majority of the CPRA’s provisions are expected to take effect on\\nJanuary  1,  2023,  and  additional  compliance  investment  and  potential  business  process  changes  will  likely  be  required.  Virginia,  Utah,  Colorado,  and\\nConnecticut, have passed similar laws, which come into force in 2023, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States.\\nOther  states,  such  as  California  and  Massachusetts,  have  passed  specific  laws  mandating  reasonable  security  measures  for  the  handling  of  personal\\ninformation.\\n\\nIn Europe, we are subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 and applicable national supplementing laws (“EU\\nGDPR”) and to the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), (the EU GDPR and UK GDPR\\ntogether referred to as the “GDPR”). The GDPR imposes comprehensive compliance obligations regarding our processing of personal data, including a\\nprinciple of accountability and the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit[1]. Further, the GDPR regulates\\ncross-border  transfers  of  personal  data  out  of  the  European  Economic  Area  and  the  United  Kingdom.  On  July  16,  2020,  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the\\nEuropean Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (“Privacy Shield”) under which personal data could be transferred from these\\njurisdictions  to  relevant  self-certified  U.S.  entities.  The  CJEU  further  noted  that  reliance  on  the  European  Commission  standard  contractual  clauses  (a\\npotential  alternative  transfer  mechanism  to  the  Privacy  Shield)  alone  may  not  necessarily  be  sufficient  in  all  circumstances  and  that  transfers  must  be\\nassessed on a case-by-case basis. We currently rely on the standard contractual clauses with respect to both intragroup and third party transfers. As the\\nenforcement  landscape  further  develops,  and  supervisory  authorities  issue  further  guidance  on  international  data  transfers,  and  governments  agree  on\\nadditional transfer mechanisms, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines; we may have to stop using certain\\ntools  and  vendors  and  make  other  operational  changes;  we  have  had  to  and  will  have  to  implement  revised  standard  contractual  clauses  for  existing\\nintragroup, customer and vendor arrangements within required time frames; and/or it could otherwise affect the manner in which we provide our services,\\nand  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operations  and  financial  condition.  Failure  to  comply  with  the  EU  GDPR  and  the  UK  GDPR  could  result  in\\npenalties under each of these regimes independently in respect of the same breach. Penalties for certain breaches are up to the greater of EUR 20 million/\\nGBP 17.5 million or 4% of our global annual turnover. In addition to fines, a breach of the GDPR may result in regulatory investigations, reputational\\ndamage,  orders  to  cease/change  our  data  processing  activities,  enforcement  notices,  assessment  notices  (for  a  compulsory  audit)  and/  or  civil  claims\\n(including class actions).\\n\\nWe are also subject to evolving EU and UK privacy laws on cookies, tracking technologies and e-marketing. If regulators continue their trend of\\nincreasing enforcement of the strict approach to opt-in consent for all but essential use cases and given the complex and evolving nature of EU and UK\\nprivacy laws, this may lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, require that we\\ndivert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, subject us to additional liabilities and there can be no assurances that we will\\nbe successful in our compliance efforts.\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##This  legislation  may  add  additional  complexity,  variation  in  requirements,  restrictions  and  potential  legal  risk,  require  additional  investment  in\\nresources to compliance programs, could impact strategies and availability of previously useful data, and could result in increased compliance costs and/or\\nchanges in business practices and policies. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any federal, state, or\\ninternational privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, or other legal obligations relating to data privacy and information security could\\nadversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may result in claims, liabilities, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or\\nothers, or may require us to change our operations. Any such claims, proceedings or actions could hurt our reputation, brand and business, force us to incur\\nsignificant expenses in defense of such proceedings or actions, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, and result in the imposition\\nof monetary penalties.\\n\\nRisks related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\\n\\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\\n\\nCertain  provisions  of  Delaware  law,  our  amended  and  restated  certificate  of  incorporation,  amended  and  restated  bylaws,  and  our  Stockholders\\nAgreement may have an antitakeover effect and may delay, defer, or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt, or other change of control\\ntransaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares\\nheld by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things:\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;\\nadvance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;\\ncertain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;\\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\\nthat certain provisions of amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended only by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the\\nvoting power represented by our then-outstanding common stock;\\nthe  right  of  each  of  the  AES  Related  Parties,  Siemens  Related  Parties,  and  the  QIA  Related  Parties  (each  as  defined  in  the  Stockholders\\nAgreement) to nominate certain of our directors;\\nthe shares of our Class B-1 common stock held by our Founders entitle them to five votes per share on all matters presented to our stockholders\\ngenerally; and\\nthe consent rights of the Continuing Equity Owners in the Stockholders Agreement.\\n\\nThese antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by\\n\\nmany of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\\n\\nIn addition, we have opted out of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which we refer to as the DGCL, but our\\namended  and  restated  certificate  of  incorporation  will  provide  that  engaging  in  any  of  a  broad  range  of  business  combinations  with  any  “interested”\\nstockholder (any stockholder with 15% or more of our voting stock) for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an\\n“interested” stockholder is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions.\\n\\nThe JOBS Act will allow us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce\\nthe amount of information we provide in our reports filed with the SEC. We cannot be certain if this reduced disclosure will make our Class A common\\nstock less attractive to investors.\\n\\nThe JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on “emerging growth companies.” As defined in the JOBS Act, a public company whose\\ninitial public offering of common equity securities occurs after December 8, 2011, and whose annual net revenues are less than $1.235 billion will, in\\ngeneral, qualify as an emerging growth company until the earliest of:\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\nthe last day of its fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of its initial public offering of common equity securities;\\nthe last day of its fiscal year in which it has annual gross revenue of $1.235 billion or more;\\nthe date on which it has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and\\nthe date on which it is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” which will occur at such time as the company (1) has an aggregate worldwide\\nmarket value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of its most recently completed\\nsecond fiscal quarter, (2) has been required to file annual and quarterly reports\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, for a period of at least 12 months, and (3) has filed at least one\\nannual report pursuant to the Exchange Act.\\n\\nUnder  this  definition,  we  are  an  emerging  growth  company  and  may  remain  an  emerging  growth  company  until  as  late  as  September  30,  2026.\\nHowever, we anticipate no longer being an emerging growth company as soon as September 30, 2023. For so long as we are an emerging growth company,\\nwe are, among other things:\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nnot be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\\nnot be required to hold a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation pursuant to Section 14A(a) of the Exchange Act;\\nnot  be  required  to  seek  stockholder  approval  of  any  golden  parachute  payments  not  previously  approved  pursuant  to  Section  14A(b)  of  the\\nExchange Act;\\nbe exempt from the requirement of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, regarding the communication of critical audit\\nmatters in the auditor’s report on the financial statements; and\\nbe subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.\\n\\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can use the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the\\nSecurities  Act  for  complying  with  new  or  revised  accounting  standards.  This  permits  an  emerging  growth  company  to  delay  the  adoption  of  certain\\naccounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, for the year-ended September 30, 2022, we have “opted\\nout” of this election and elected to comply with the financial accounting standard effective dates applicable to non-emerging growth companies.\\n\\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of our decision to take advantage of some or all of the\\nreduced disclosure requirements above. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading\\nmarket for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\\n\\nBecause we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any\\nreturn on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\\n\\nWe do not anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay\\ndividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, general and economic conditions,\\nour results of operations and financial condition, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and\\nregulatory restrictions, and such other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is, and may be, limited\\nby covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Therefore, any return on investment in our Class A common stock is\\nsolely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our Class A common stock on the open market, which may not occur.\\n\\nThe dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock. We cannot predict the effect our\\nmultiple class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\\n\\nCertain stock index providers, such as S&P Dow Jones, exclude companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to\\ncertain stock indices, including the S&P 500. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms and large institutional investors oppose the use of multiple\\nclass structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in such indices, may\\ncause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our\\ncapital structure, and may result in large institutional investors not purchasing shares of our Class A common stock. Any exclusion from stock indices\\ncould  result  in  a  less  active  trading  market  for  our  Class  A  common  stock.  Any  actions  or  publications  by  stockholder  advisory  firms  or  institutional\\ninvestors critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.\\n\\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain\\ncorporate governance requirements. You may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such corporate\\ngovernance requirements.\\n\\nOur Continuing Equity Owners have more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors, and, as a result, we are considered a “controlled\\ncompany” for the purposes of the Nasdaq rules. As such, we qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements,\\nincluding the requirements to have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors, an entirely independent compensation committee or to\\nhave director nominations be made, or recommended to the full board of directors, by its independent directors or by a nominations committee that is\\ncomposed entirely of independent directors. The corporate governance requirements and, specifically, the independence standards are intended to ensure\\ndirectors who are considered independent are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors.\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Accordingly,  you  may  not  have  the  same  protections  afforded  to  stockholders  of  companies  that  are  subject  to  all  of  the  corporate  governance\\nrequirements of the Nasdaq rules.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive forum\\nprovision  shall  not  apply  to  claims  seeking  to  enforce  any  liability  or  duty  created  by  the  Exchange  Act.  The  choice  of  forum  provision  may  limit  a\\nstockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may\\ndiscourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision\\ncontained  in  our  amended  and  restated  certificate  of  incorporation  to  be  inapplicable  or  unenforceable  in  an  action,  we  may  incur  additional  costs\\nassociated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any person or\\nentity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions\\nin our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\\n\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of “corporate opportunity” does not apply with respect to any director\\nor stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries.\\n\\nThe doctrine of corporate opportunity generally provides that a corporate fiduciary may not develop an opportunity using corporate resources, acquire\\nan interest adverse to that of the corporation or acquire property that is reasonably incident to the present or prospective business of the corporation or in\\nwhich the corporation has a present or expectancy interest, unless that opportunity is first presented to the corporation and the corporation chooses not to\\npursue that opportunity. The doctrine of corporate opportunity is intended to preclude officers or directors or other fiduciaries from personally benefiting\\nfrom  opportunities  that  belong  to  the  corporation.  Our  amended  and  restated  certificate  of  incorporation  provides  that  the  doctrine  of  “corporate\\nopportunity” will not apply with respect to any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries. Any director or stockholder who is\\nnot employed by us or our subsidiaries, therefore, has no duty to communicate or present corporate opportunities to us, and has the right to either hold any\\ncorporate opportunity for their (and their affiliates’) own account and benefit or to recommend, assign or otherwise transfer such corporate opportunity to\\npersons other than us, including to any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries.\\n\\nAs a result, certain of our stockholders, directors, and their respective affiliates, including AES Grid Stability, Siemens AG and affiliates, the Blocker\\nShareholder, and any of our directors nominated by them that is not employed by us or our subsidiaries, are not prohibited from operating or investing in\\ncompeting businesses. We, therefore, may find ourselves in competition with certain of our stockholders, directors, or their respective affiliates, and we\\nmay not have knowledge of, or be able to pursue, transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly, we may lose a corporate opportunity\\nor suffer competitive harm, which could negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\\n\\nYou may be diluted by future issuances of additional Class A common stock or common units in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or\\notherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price.\\n\\nThe sale of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market\\nprice of shares of our Class A common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell\\nequity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\\n\\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had outstanding a total of 114,873,121 shares of Class A common stock. Of the outstanding shares, 37,793,151 shares\\n\\nheld by public investors are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, other\\n\\n41\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##than any shares held by our affiliates. Any shares of Class A common stock held by our affiliates will be eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the\\nSecurities Act, subject to the volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144.\\n\\nIn addition, we, Fluence Energy, LLC and the Continuing Equity Owners are party to the Fluence Energy, LLC Agreement under which the Continuing\\nEquity Owners (or certain permitted transferees thereof) have the right (subject to the terms of the Fluence Energy, LLC Agreement) to have their common\\nunits redeemed from time to time at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within the meaning of the rules of the Nasdaq) who are\\ndisinterested), newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment from the sale of newly issued shares of Class A\\ncommon stock equal to a volume weighted average market price of one share of Class A common stock for each common unit so redeemed, in each case,\\nin accordance with the terms of the Fluence Energy, LLC Agreement; provided that, at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within\\nthe meaning of the rules of the Nasdaq) who are disinterested), we may effect a direct exchange by us of such Class A common stock or such cash, as\\napplicable, for such common units. The Continuing Equity Owners may exercise such redemption right, subject to certain exceptions, for as long as their\\ncommon  units  remain  outstanding.  For  example,  in  July  2022,  Siemens  Industry  exercised  its  redemption  right  with  respect  to  its  entire  holding  of\\n58,586,695 common units, which we elected to settle through the issuance of 58,586,695 shares of Class A common stock. The market price of shares of\\nour Class A common stock could decline as a result of these redemptions or exchanges or the perception that a redemption or exchange could occur. These\\nredemptions or exchanges, or the possibility that these redemptions or exchanges may occur, also might make it more difficult for holders of our Class A\\ncommon stock to sell such stock in the future at a time and at a price that they deem appropriate.\\n\\nIn addition, we have granted options to acquire shares of Class A common stock pursuant to equity incentives issued pursuant to the 2020 Unit Option\\nPlan of Fluence Energy, LLC (the “Existing Equity Plan”), of which approximately 8,044,880 are outstanding as of November 30, 2022. Further, we have\\ngranted phantom shares conveying the right to receive cash or equity based upon the value of Class A common stock, of which 411,783 are outstanding as\\nof November 30, 2022. Finally, we have reserved 9,500,000 shares of Class A common stock for issuance under the Fluence Energy, Inc. 2021 Incentive\\nAward Plan (the “2021 Equity Plan”), of which 2,706,101 have been granted in the form of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and are outstanding as of\\nNovember 30, 2022. Any additional Class A common stock that we issue under the 2021 Equity Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in\\nthe future would be dilutive to Class A common stockholders.\\n\\nIn the future, we may also issue securities in connection with investments, acquisitions or capital raising activities, which could constitute a material\\nportion of our then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock. Further in connection with the completion of the IPO, we entered into a Registration\\nRights Agreement with certain of the Continuing Equity Owners. Any such issuance of additional securities or any exercise of registration rights or the\\nprospect of any such sales, could materially impact the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through\\nfuture sales of equity securities.\\n\\nRisks Related to Our Existing Shareholders\\n\\nOur certificate of incorporation limit our Continuing Equity Owners’ and their directors’ and officers’ liability to us or you for breach of fiduciary duty\\nand could also prevent us from benefiting from corporate opportunities that might otherwise have been available to us.\\n\\nOur  certificate  of  incorporation  provides  that,  subject  to  any  contractual  provision  to  the  contrary,  our  Continuing  Equity  Owners  will  have  no\\n\\nobligation to refrain from:\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nengaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as we do;\\n\\ndoing business with any of our clients, customers, vendors or lessors;\\n\\nemploying or otherwise engaging any of our officers or employees; or\\n\\n• making investments in any property in which we may make investments.\\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, neither Continuing Equity Owners nor any officer or director of Continuing Equity Owners, except as provided\\n\\nin our certificate of incorporation, will be liable to us or to our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any of these activities.\\n\\nAny interests or expectancy in corporate opportunities which become known to (i) any of our directors or officers who are also directors, officers,\\nemployees  or  other  affiliates  of  Continuing  Equity  Owners  or  their  affiliates  (except  that  we  and  our  subsidiaries  shall  not  be  deemed  affiliates  of\\nContinuing Equity Owners or its affiliates for the purposes of the provision), or dual persons, or (ii) our Continuing Equity Owners themselves, and which\\nrelate  to  the  business  of  Fluence  or  may  constitute  a  corporate  opportunity  for  both  our  Continuing  Equity  Owners  and  us.  Generally,  neither  our\\nContinuing Equity Owners nor our directors or officers who are also dual persons will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty\\nby reason of the fact that any such person\\n\\n42\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for the account of our Continuing Equity Owners or their affiliates, directs, recommends, sells, assigns or\\notherwise transfers such corporate opportunity to Our Continuing Equity Owners or its affiliates, or does not communicate information regarding such\\ncorporate  opportunity  to  us.  The  corporate  opportunity  provision  may  exacerbate  conflicts  of  interest  between  our  Continuing  Equity  Owners  and  us\\nbecause  the  provision  effectively  permits  one  of  our  directors  or  officers  who  also  serves  as  a  director,  officer,  employee,  or  other  affiliate  of  Our\\nContinuing Equity Owners to choose to direct a corporate opportunity to our Continuing Equity Owners instead of us.\\n\\nOur Continuing Equity Owners are not restricted from competing with us in the energy storage business, including as a result of acquiring a company\\nthat operates an energy storage business. Due to the significant resources of our Continuing Equity Owners, including their intellectual property (all of\\nwhich  our  Continuing  Equity  Owners  retain  and  certain  of  which  they  license  to  us  under  the  IP  License  Agreements),  financial  resources,  name\\nrecognition and know-how resulting from the previous management of our business, our Continuing Equity Owners could have a significant competitive\\nadvantage over us should it decide to utilize these resources to engage in the type of business we conduct, which may cause our operating results and\\nfinancial condition to be materially adversely affected.\\n\\nWe are controlled by the Continuing Equity Owners, whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\\n\\nThe Continuing Equity Owners control approximately 90.7% of the combined voting power of our common stock through their ownership of both\\nClass A common stock and Class B-1 common stock. The Continuing Equity Owners will, for the foreseeable future, have the ability to substantially\\ninfluence us through their ownership position over corporate management and affairs. The Continuing Equity Owners are able to, subject to applicable law,\\nand the voting arrangements, elect a majority of the members of our board of directors and control actions to be taken by us and our board of directors,\\nincluding amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers and sales of\\nsubstantially all of our assets. The directors so elected will have the authority, subject to the terms of our indebtedness and applicable rules and regulations,\\nto  issue  additional  stock,  implement  stock  repurchase  programs,  declare  dividends  and  make  other  decisions.  It  is  possible  that  the  interests  of  the\\nContinuing Equity Owners may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders, including you. For example,\\nthe Continuing Equity Owners may have different tax positions from us, especially in light of the Tax Receivable Agreement, that could influence our\\ndecisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, and whether and when we\\nshould terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate its obligations thereunder. In addition, the determination of future tax reporting positions\\nand the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration the Continuing Equity Owners’ tax or other considerations, which may differ from the\\nconsiderations of us or our other stockholders.\\n\\nCertain of our officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with our Continuing Equity Owners.\\n\\nRicardo Falu, Tish Mendoza, Barbara Humpton, Emma Falck, Axel Meier, Chris Shelton and Simon Smith serve on our board of directors and are\\nemployed  by  and  have  retained  their  positions  with  AES,  Siemens,  or  QIA,  as  applicable.  These  individuals’  holdings  in  and  compensation  from  the\\nrelevant Continuing Equity Owners may be significant for some of these persons. Their positions at AES, Siemens, or QIA, their compensation from AES,\\nSiemens or QIA and the ownership of any equity or equity awards in AES, Siemens, or QIA, as applicable, may create the appearance of conflicts of\\ninterest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our Continuing Equity Owners than the decisions have\\nfor us.\\n\\nWe rely on our access to our Founders’ brands and reputation, some of our Founders’ relationships, and the brands and reputations of unaffiliated\\nthird parties.\\n\\nWe believe the association with our Founders has contributed to our building relationships with our customers due to their recognized brands and\\nproducts, as well as resources such as their intellectual property and access to third parties’ intellectual property. Any perceived loss of our Founders’ scale,\\ncapital  base  and  financial  strength,  or  any  actual  loss  or  reduction  in  the  Founders’  ownership  in  the  future,  may  prompt  business  partners  to  reprice,\\nmodify or terminate their relationships with us. In addition, our Founders’ reduction of their ownership of our company may cause some of our existing\\nagreements and licenses to be terminated.\\n\\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for liabilities of our Founders, which could result in a decrease in our income.\\n\\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for our Founders’ liabilities. If those liabilities are significant and we are ultimately held liable for them,\\n\\nwe cannot assure that we will be able to recover the full amount of our losses from our Founders.\\n\\nWe may be required to pay additional taxes as a result of partnership tax audit rules.\\n\\nWe may be required to pay additional taxes as a result of partnership audit rules under U.S. federal and other applicable income tax law. The Bipartisan\\n\\nBudget Act of 2015 changed the rules applicable to U.S. federal income tax audits of partnerships, including\\n\\n43\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##entities such as Fluence Energy, LLC. Under these rules (which generally are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017), subject to\\ncertain exceptions, audit adjustments to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of an entity (and any holder’s share thereof) are determined, and\\ntaxes, interest, and penalties attributable thereto, are assessed and collected, at the partnership level. Although there is uncertainty about how these rules\\nwill continue to be implemented, it is possible that they could result in Fluence Energy, LLC (or any of its subsidiaries that are or have been treated as\\npartnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) being required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment, and we,\\nas an owner of Fluence Energy, LLC (or as an indirect owner of such other entities), could be required to indirectly bear the economic burden of those\\ntaxes, interest, and penalties even if they relate to periods prior to the IPO and even though we may not otherwise have been required to pay additional\\ncorporate-level taxes as a result of the related audit adjustment.\\n\\nWe may incur certain tax liabilities attributable to the Blocker Company as a result of the Transactions.\\n\\nIn connection with the Transactions, and pursuant to the Blocker Mergers, the Blocker Company merged with and into us. As the successor to the\\nBlocker Company, we will generally succeed to and be responsible for any outstanding or historical liabilities, including tax liabilities, of the Blocker\\nCompany, including any liabilities that might be incurred as a result of the Blocker Mergers. Any such liabilities for which we are responsible could have\\nan adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\\n\\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\\n\\nOur principal asset is our interest in Fluence Energy, LLC, and, as a result, we depend on distributions from Fluence Energy, LLC to pay our taxes\\nand expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Fluence Energy, LLC’s ability to make such distributions may be subject to\\nvarious limitations and restrictions.\\n\\nWe  are  a  holding  company  and  have  no  material  assets  other  than  our  ownership  of  LLC  Interests.  As  such,  we  have  no  independent  means  of\\ngenerating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future, if any, are dependent\\nupon the financial results and cash flows of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from Fluence Energy, LLC. There can be\\nno assurance that Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and\\ncontractual  restrictions,  including  negative  covenants  in  our  debt  instruments,  will  permit  such  distributions.  The  Revolver  limits,  and  our  future  debt\\nagreements may similarly limit, our ability to make certain payments, including dividends and distributions on Fluence Energy, LLC’s equity, Fluence\\nEnergy, Inc.’s equity and other restricted payments.\\n\\nFluence Energy, LLC continues to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally is not subject to any entity-\\nlevel U.S. federal income tax. Instead, any taxable income of Fluence Energy, LLC will be allocated to holders of LLC Interests, including us. Accordingly,\\nwe incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of Fluence Energy, LLC. We expect to use distributions from Fluence Energy, LLC\\nto fund any payments that we are required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Under the terms of the Fluence Energy LLC Agreement, Fluence\\nEnergy, LLC is obligated, subject to various limitations and restrictions, including with respect to our debt agreements, to make tax distributions to holders\\nof LLC Interests, including us, although tax distributions may not be paid in whole or in part in certain circumstances, including if Fluence Energy, LLC\\ndoes  not  have  available  cash  to  make  such  distributions.  In  addition  to  tax  expenses,  we  will  also  incur  expenses  related  to  our  operations,  including\\npayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which we expect could be significant. We intend, as its managing member, to cause Fluence Energy, LLC\\nto make cash distributions to the holders of LLC Interests in an amount sufficient to (1) fund all or part of their tax obligations in respect of taxable income\\nallocated to them and (2) cover our operating expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, Fluence Energy, LLC’s ability\\nto make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract\\nor agreement to which Fluence Energy, LLC is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering\\nFluence Energy, LLC insolvent. If we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities, or to fund our operations (including, if applicable, as a\\nresult of an acceleration of our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement), we may have to borrow funds, which could materially and adversely\\naffect our liquidity and financial condition, and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any lenders of such funds. To the extent we are unable to make\\ntimely  payments  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  for  any  reason,  such  payments  generally  will  be  deferred  and  will  accrue  interest  until  paid;\\nprovided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement\\nresulting in the acceleration of payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, if Fluence Energy, LLC does not have sufficient funds to\\nmake distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends will also be restricted or impaired. See “—Risks related to ownership of our Class A\\ncommon stock”.\\n\\n44\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##As a result of (1) potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and to Fluence Energy, LLC’s other equity holders, (2) the\\nlower tax rate applicable to corporations as opposed to individuals, and (3) certain tax benefits that we anticipate from (a) future redemptions or exchanges\\nof LLC Interests from the Founders, (b) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and (c) certain other transactions, tax distributions to us may be in\\namounts that exceed our tax liabilities. Our board of directors will determine the appropriate uses for any excess cash so accumulated, which may include,\\namong other uses, the payment of obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash)\\nto our stockholders. No adjustments to the redemption or exchange ratio or price for LLC Interests and corresponding shares of Class B-1 or Class B-2\\ncommon stock will be made as a result of any cash distribution by us or any retention of cash by us. To the extent we do not distribute such excess cash as\\ndividends on our Class A common stock, we may take other actions with respect to such excess cash, for example, holding such excess cash, or lending it\\n(or a portion thereof) to Fluence Energy, LLC or its subsidiaries, which may result in shares of our Class A common stock increasing in value relative to the\\nvalue of LLC Interests. The holders of LLC Interests may benefit from any value attributable to such cash balances or loan receivables if they acquire\\nshares  of  Class  A  common  stock  in  exchange  for  their  LLC  Interests  or  otherwise  exercise  their  rights  to  redeem  or  exchange  their  LLC  Interests,\\nnotwithstanding that such holders may have participated previously as holders of LLC Interests in distributions by Fluence Energy, LLC that resulted in the\\nexcess cash balances.\\n\\nThe  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  with  the  Founders  requires  us  to  make  cash  payments  to  them  in  respect  of  certain  tax  benefits  to  which  we  may\\nbecome entitled, and we expect that such payments will be substantial.\\n\\nWe are party to a Tax Receivable Agreement with Fluence Energy, LLC and the Founders. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are required to\\nmake cash payments to such Founders equal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize, as\\na result of (1) the increases in our share of the tax basis of assets of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries resulting from any redemptions or exchanges\\nof LLC Interests from the Founders and certain distributions (or deemed distributions) by Fluence Energy, LLC; and (2) certain other tax benefits arising\\nfrom payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For example, as a result of the July 2022 redemption by Siemens with respect to its entire holding of\\n58,586,695  common  units  of  Fluence  Energy,  LLC,  we  estimated  tax  savings  of  approximately  $109.6  million.  Siemens  will  be  entitled  to  receive\\npayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement equaling 85% of such amount, or $93.1 million; assuming, among other factors, (i) we will have sufficient\\ntaxable income to fully utilize the tax benefits; (ii) Fluence Energy, LLC is able to fully depreciate or amortize its assets; and (iii) no material changes in\\napplicable  tax  law.  We  anticipate  funding  ordinary  course  payments  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  from  cash  flow  from  operations  of  our\\nsubsidiaries, available cash or available borrowings under any future debt agreements. We expect that the amount of the cash payments we will be required\\nto make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. Any payments made by us to the Founders under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not\\nbe available for reinvestment in our business and will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us and\\nhave a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any\\nreason, the unpaid amounts generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may\\nconstitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting in the acceleration of payments due under the Tax\\nReceivable  Agreement.  The  payments  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  are  not  conditioned  upon  continued  ownership  of  us  by  the  redeeming  or\\nexchanging Founders. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for\\nan acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement.\\nThe actual increase in tax basis, and the actual utilization of any resulting tax benefits, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax\\nReceivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors: including the timing of redemptions of exchanges by the Founders; the price of\\nshares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange; the extent to which such redemptions or exchanges are taxable; the amount of gain\\nrecognized by such Founders; the amount and timing of the taxable income allocated to us or otherwise generated by us in the future; the portion of our\\npayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement constituting imputed interest; and the federal and state tax rates then applicable.\\n\\nOur organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the Founders that will not benefit holders of our\\nClass A common stock to the same extent that it will benefit the Founders.\\n\\nOur organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the Founders that will not benefit the holders of\\nour Class A common stock to the same extent that it will benefit such Founders. We are party to the Tax Receivable Agreement with Fluence Energy, LLC\\nand certain Founders, which provides for the payment by us to such Founders of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in\\nsome circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (1) the increases in our share of the tax basis of assets of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries\\nresulting from any future redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests from the Founders and certain distributions (or deemed distributions) by Fluence\\nEnergy, LLC and (2) certain other tax benefits arising from payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Although we will retain 15% of the amount of\\nsuch tax benefits, this and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the future trading market for the Class A common stock.\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated or significantly exceed any actual benefits we realize in respect of\\nthe tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\\n\\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if (1) we materially breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and the\\nContinuing  Equity  Owners  elect  an  early  termination  of  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement,  (2)  certain  mergers,  asset  sales,  other  forms  of  business\\ncombinations or other changes of control were to occur after the consummation of the IPO and the Continuing Equity Owners elect an early termination of\\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement, or (3) we elect, at any time, an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then our obligations, or our successor’s\\nobligations, under the Tax Receivable Agreement to make payments would be based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have\\nsufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\\n\\nAs a result of the foregoing, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits\\nthat are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, based on certain assumptions, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual\\nrealization,  if  any,  of  such  future  tax  benefits.  We  could  also  be  required  to  make  cash  payments  to  the  Founders  that  are  greater  than  the\\nspecified percentage of any actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. In these\\nsituations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of\\ndelaying, deferring, or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. There can be no assurance\\nthat we will be able to fund or finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent we are unable to make timely payments under\\nthe  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  for  any  reason,  such  payments  generally  will  be  deferred  and  will  accrue  interest  until  paid;  provided,  however,  that\\nnonpayment  for  a  specified  period  may  constitute  a  material  breach  of  a  material  obligation  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  resulting  in  the\\nacceleration of payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement\\nto  the  extent  our  cash  resources  are  insufficient  to  meet  our  obligations  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  as  a  result  of  timing  discrepancies  or\\notherwise.\\n\\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\\n\\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service,\\nor the IRS, or another tax authority, may challenge all or part of the tax basis increases or other tax benefits we claim, as well as other related tax positions\\nwe take, and a court could sustain such challenge. If the outcome of any audit of us or our subsidiaries is reasonably expected to adversely affect the rights\\nand obligations of the Founders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in a material respect, then we will notify the Founders of such audit, keep them\\nreasonably informed with respect thereto, provide them with a reasonable opportunity to provide information and other input concerning the audit or the\\nrelevant portion thereof and consider such information and other input in good faith. The interests of such Founders in any such challenge may differ from\\nor conflict with our interests and your interests, and the Founders may exercise their rights relating to any such challenge in a manner adverse to our\\ninterests and your interests. We will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any\\ntax benefits initially claimed by us and for which payment has been made are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed.\\nInstead, any excess cash payments made by us will be netted against any future cash payments we might otherwise be required to make to the applicable\\nFounder under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to a\\nFounder for a number of years following the initial time of such payment and, if any of our tax reporting positions are challenged by a taxing authority, we\\nwill not be permitted to reduce any future cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement until any such challenge is finally settled or determined.\\nMoreover, the excess cash payments we made previously under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be greater than the amount of future cash payments\\nagainst which we would otherwise be permitted to net such excess. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules for determining applicable tax benefits we\\nmay claim are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions. As a\\nresult, payments could be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement significantly in excess of any actual cash tax savings that we realize in respect of the\\ntax attributes that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement.\\n\\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect\\nour results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nWe are subject to taxes by the U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or\\n\\nadversely affected by a number of factors, including:\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\nallocation of expenses to and among different jurisdictions;\\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##•\\n•\\n•\\n\\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\\nchanges in tax laws, tax treaties, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\\nlower  than  anticipated  future  earnings  in  jurisdictions  where  we  have  lower  statutory  tax  rates  and  higher  than  anticipated  future  earnings  in\\njurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\\n\\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other taxes by U.S. federal, state, and local, and foreign taxing authorities. Outcomes\\n\\nfrom these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\\n\\nIf we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act, including as a result of our\\nownership of Fluence Energy, LLC, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\\n\\nUnder Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes of the 1940 Act\\nif (1) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities,\\nor (2) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire\\ninvestment  securities  having  a  value  exceeding  40%  of  the  value  of  its  total  assets  (exclusive  of  U.S.  government  securities  and  cash  items)  on  an\\nunconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an “investment company,” as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.\\n\\nWe and Fluence Energy, LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. As the sole managing member\\nof Fluence Energy, LLC, we will control and operate Fluence Energy, LLC. On that basis, we believe that our interest in Fluence Energy, LLC is not an\\n“investment security” as that term is used in the 1940 Act. However, if we were to cease participation in the management of Fluence Energy, LLC, or if\\nFluence Energy, LLC itself becomes an investment company, our interest in Fluence Energy, LLC could be deemed an “investment security” for purposes\\nof the 1940 Act.\\n\\nWe and Fluence Energy, LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. If it were established that we\\nwere an unregistered investment company, there would be a risk that we would be subject to monetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought\\nby the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties and that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions undertaken\\nduring  the  period  it  was  established  that  we  were  an  unregistered  investment  company.  If  we  were  required  to  register  as  an  investment  company,\\nrestrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for\\nus to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\\n\\nGeneral Risk Factors\\n\\nAs a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with\\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these\\ninternal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common\\nstock. In addition, because of our status as an emerging growth company, you will not be able to depend on any attestation from our independent\\nregistered public accountants as to our internal control over financial reporting for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nWe  are  a  public  reporting  company  subject  to  the  rules  and  regulations  established  from  time  to  time  by  the  SEC  and  Nasdaq.  These  rules  and\\nregulations require, among other things, that we have and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. The\\nprocess of designing and implementing internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this requirement is time-consuming, costly, and\\ncomplicated.\\n\\nUnder Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act our management is required to assess and report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control\\nover financial reporting and to identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Once we are no longer an emerging growth\\ncompany, Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require our independent registered public accounting firm to issue an annual report that addresses\\nthe  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  If  during  the  evaluation  and  testing  process  we  identify  one  or  more  other  material\\nweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or determine that existing material weaknesses have not been fully remediated, our management\\nwill be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our\\ninternal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented, or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an\\nongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\\n\\nAs discussed in “Item 9A – Controls and Procedures – Management’s Report in Internal Control over Financial Reporting,” as of September 30, 2022,\\n\\na material weakness in the internal control over the revenue recognition process and the related inventory has not\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##been fully remediated. The Company did not sufficiently design and implement controls related to revenue recognition and related inventory and associated\\nprocesses, including in-transit and delivered equipment and liquidated damages. We are actively engaged in implementing a remediation plan to address the\\nmaterial weakness.\\n\\nThe  material  weakness  will  not  be  considered  fully  remediated  until  management  designs  and  implements  effective  controls  that  operate  for  a\\n\\nsufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective.\\n\\nOur independent registered public accounting firm was not required to, and did not, attest formally or perform an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, in accordance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Accordingly, you will not\\nbe able to depend on any attestation concerning our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accountants and we\\ncannot assure you that we have identified all, or that we will not in the future have additional, material weaknesses.\\n\\nWe cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing, and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations.\\nIf  we  are  not  able  to  implement  the  requirements  of  Section  404  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  in  a  timely  manner  or  with  adequate  compliance,  our\\nindependent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse opinion due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting, and we may be\\nsubject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Nasdaq or SEC. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial\\nmarkets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal\\ncontrol system and the hiring of additional personnel. Any such action could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\\n\\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings, regulatory disputes, and governmental inquiries that could cause us to incur significant\\nexpenses, divert our management’s attention, and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe have been and continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other proceedings that arise out of our operations and\\nbusinesses and that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, intellectual property matters, contract and employment claims, personal injury\\nclaims, product liability claims, and warranty claims. In addition, since our energy storage product is a new type of product in a nascent market, we have in\\nthe past needed and may in the future need to seek the amendment of existing regulations or, in some cases, the creation of new regulations, in order to\\noperate  our  business  in  some  jurisdictions.  Such  regulatory  processes  may  require  public  hearings  concerning  our  business,  which  could  expose  us  to\\nsubsequent  litigation.  Litigation  and  regulatory  proceedings  may  be  protracted  and  expensive,  and  the  results  are  difficult  to  predict.  Certain  of  these\\nmatters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Unfavorable outcomes or developments relating to proceedings to\\nwhich we are a party or transactions involving our products and services, such as judgments for monetary damages, injunctions, or denial or revocation of\\npermits,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  of  operations.  In  addition,  settlement  of  claims  could\\nadversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\\n\\nNone.\\n\\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\\n\\nOur  corporate  headquarters  are  in  Arlington,  Virginia,  and  consist  of  approximately  17,000  square  feet  of  office  space.  We  lease  our  corporate\\nheadquarters. We also have offices in Alpharetta, Georgia; San Francisco, California; Erlangen, Germany; Zurich, Switzerland; Melbourne, Australia; New\\nDelhi, India; and Taguig City, Philippines. Our Erlangen office includes an energy storage testing facility.\\n\\nIn addition to our office space, we also lease operational facilities in Rockville, Maryland; East Huntingdon Township, Pennsylvania; and Los Angeles,\\n\\nCalifornia. These facilities are primarily for product staging and storage and research and development activities.\\n\\nWe believe that our existing properties are in good condition and are sufficient and suitable for the conduct of our business for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nTo the extent our needs change as our business grows, we expect that additional space and facilities will be available.\\n\\nWe have gone through rigorous certification processes at several of our offices and are actively pursuing additional certification at others. The corporate\\noffice space and the testing facility in Erlangen are ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 45001 certified (quality,\\nenvironmental and safety certifications, respectively). Our Melbourne office is ISO 9001 certified, and our U.S. Arlington office is SA8000 certified which\\nis a standard of ethical and decent working conditions.\\n\\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\n\\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims that arise out of our operations and businesses and that cover a wide range of\\nmatters,  including,  among  others,  intellectual  property  matters,  contract  disputes,  insurance  and  property  damage  claims,  employment  claims,  personal\\ninjury claims, product liability claims, environmental claims and warranty claims. Currently, there are no claims or proceedings against us that we believe\\nwill have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the results of any current or future\\nlitigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, we may incur significant costs and experience a diversion of management\\nresources as a result of claims and litigation.\\n\\nFor a description of our material pending legal contingencies, please see Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies,  to  the  consolidated  financial\\n\\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\\n\\nITEM 4.

This  discussion  may  contain  forward-looking  statements  based  upon  current  expectations  that  involve  risks  and\\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including\\nthose set forth under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” or in other parts of this Annual Report. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the\\nresults that may be expected for any periods in the future.\\n\\nUpon the completion of our IPO on November 1, 2021, Fluence Energy, Inc. became a holding company whose sole material assets are the LLC\\nInterests in Fluence Energy LLC. All of our business is conducted through Fluence Energy, LLC, together with its subsidiaries, and the financial results of\\nFluence Energy, LLC will be consolidated in our financial statements. Fluence Energy LLC is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and,\\nas  a  result,  its  members,  including  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  will  pay  income  taxes  with  respect  to  their  allocable  shares  of  its  net  taxable  income.  As  of\\nSeptember 30, 2022, Fluence Energy, LLC had subsidiaries including Fluence Energy GmbH in Germany, Fluence Energy Pty Ltd. in Australia, Fluence\\nEnergy Inc. in the Philippines, Fluence Energy Chile SpA in Chile, Fluence Energy B.V. in Netherlands, Fluence Energy Global Production Operation LLC\\nin the US, Fluence BESS India Private Ltd in India, Nispera AG in Switzerland, and other subsidiaries yet to commence operations. Except where the\\ncontent clearly indicates otherwise, reference to “Fluence,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “the Company” refers to Fluence Energy, Inc. and all of its direct and\\nindirect subsidiaries, including Fluence Energy, LLC. When used in a historical context that is prior to the completion of the IPO, “we,” “us,” “our” or “the\\nCompany” refer to Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries.\\n\\nOur fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. References to “fiscal year 2020”, “fiscal year 2021” and “fiscal year 2022” refer to the\\n\\nfiscal years ended September 30, 2020, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\\n\\nPresentation of Financial Information\\n\\nFluence Energy, LLC is the accounting predecessor of Fluence Energy, Inc. for financial reporting purposes. Fluence Energy, Inc. will be the audited\\n\\nfinancial reporting entity for future filings. Accordingly, this Annual Report contains the following historical financial statements:\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nFluence Energy, Inc. The historical financial information of Fluence Energy, Inc. has not been included in this Annual Report prior to the IPO as\\nit  was  a  newly  incorporated  entity,  had  no  business  transactions  or  activities  prior  to  IPO  and  had  no  assets  or  liabilities  during  the  periods\\npresented prior to the IPO.\\nFluence  Energy,  LLC.  Because  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  has  no  interest  in  any  operations  other  than  those  of  Fluence  Energy,  LLC  and  its\\nsubsidiaries, the historical consolidated financial information included in this Annual Report is that of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries.\\n\\nSiemens Industry Redemption\\n\\nOn June 30, 2022, Siemens Industry, Inc. exercised its redemption right pursuant to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability\\nCompany Agreement of Fluence Energy, LLC (the “LLC Agreement”) with respect to its entire holding of 58,586,695 LLC Interests of Fluence Energy,\\nLLC,  together  with  the  corresponding  cancellation  of  an  equivalent  number  of  shares  of  Class  B-1  common  stock  of  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.,  par  value\\n$0.00001 per share (the “Redemption”).\\n\\nThe Company elected to settle the Redemption through the issuance of 58,586,695 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Shares”).\\nThe Redemption settled on July 7, 2022. Siemens Industry, Inc. effected an internal transfer of its interest in the Shares to Siemens AG at the time of\\nRedemption and as of June 30, 2022, Siemens AG became the beneficial owner of 58,586,695 shares of Class A common stock. The Redemption increased\\nthe beneficial ownership interest of the Company in Fluence Energy, LLC to 66.08% as of June 30, 2022. The impact of the change in ownership interest\\ndid not result in a change in control. The Redemption been accounted for as an equity transaction and the carrying amount of non-controlling interest has\\nbeen adjusted.\\n\\nSubsequent to the Redemption, on September 29, 2022 Siemens AG effected an internal transfer of 18,848,631 shares of Class A common stock held\\n\\nby it to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V., an affiliated entity and a permitted transferee under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement.\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Overview\\n\\nSince our inception on January 1, 2018, we have focused on international growth and developing our energy storage product and delivery services, the\\noperational services, and digital applications. We have incurred net operating losses each year since our inception. As of September 30, 2022, we have\\nfinanced our operations with equity contributions from the proceeds of our IPO, AES Grid Stability, Siemens AG and affiliates, and QFH, cash and cash\\nequivalents, negative working capital, and short-term borrowings.\\n\\nAs of September 30, 2022 we deployed cumulative 1.8 GW of energy storage products, compared to 0.9 GW as of September 30, 2021. New energy\\nstorage product contracts executed during fiscal year 2022 represented total contracted power of approximately 1.9 GW compared to 1.3 GW for fiscal year\\n2021. We recognized total revenue of $1,198.6 million, representing an increase of $517.8 million, or 76.1%, in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year\\n2020 as we expanded our sales in terms of the number of energy storage products sold as well as geographic footprint. Revenue generated from operations\\nin  the  United  States  increased  from  $468.4  million  in  fiscal  year  2021  to  $582.3  million  in  fiscal  year  2022,  representing  a  24.3%  increase.  Revenue\\ngenerated from international operations increased from $212.3 million in fiscal year 2021 to $616.3 million in fiscal year 2022, representing a 190.2%\\nincrease.\\n\\nWe had a gross loss of $62.4 million and gross profit margin of negative (5.2)% in fiscal year 2022, compared to a gross loss of $69.1 million and\\ngross  profit  margin  of  negative  (10.2)%  in  fiscal  year  2021.  The  gross  loss  in  fiscal  years  2022  and  2021  were  negatively  impacted  by  (i)  capacity\\nconstraints within the shipping industry and increased shipping costs, both of which are caused primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii)\\ncost overruns and delays we are experiencing in some projects currently under construction. Some of those costs overruns and delays are occurring in the\\nfirst Generation 6 product deliveries.\\n\\nGeneral and administrative, research and development, sales and marketing expenses increased $78.5 million, $36.7 million, and $14.6 million, or\\n205.8%,  156.7%,  and  64.5%,  respectively,  in  fiscal  year  2022,  compared  to  fiscal  year  2021  as  we  have  been  investing  heavily  in  our  human  capital,\\ntechnology, products and services to support significant increases in our operations and related revenues.\\n\\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\\n\\nAs of September 30, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic remains on-going and continues to impact the global economy. In response to the COVID-19\\npandemic, we have taken a number of actions to protect the health and well-being of our employees and personnel and to prevent the spread of COVID-19\\nwithin our operations and at customers’ project sites. Governments in affected areas and countries in which we operate have imposed a number of measures\\ndesigned to contain outbreaks of COVID-19, including business closures, travel restrictions, and quarantines. Although vaccines and booster shots are now\\nbeing distributed and administered across many parts of the world, new variants of the virus have emerged and may continue to emerge that have shown to\\nbe more contagious. Many of our customers’ project sites have experienced shutdowns and delays related to COVID-19 at some point in time during the\\npandemic, although this trend at project sites appears to be declining in many of our locations in recent months. In addition, we purchase our components\\nand materials from international and domestic vendors and are exposed to supply chain risks arising from logistics disruptions. As a large portion of our\\nbattery supply chain derives from China, the shutdowns caused by COVID-19 outbreaks and zero-COVID policy in China has caused a supply chain bottle\\nneck  and  raw  material  price  increases,  which  has  impacted  our  operations.  For  the  fiscal  year  ended  September  30,  2022,  the  Company  incurred\\n$39.1 million in COVID-19 related costs, which was included in “Cost of goods and services” in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Such\\ncosts were primarily caused by temporary closures of customer construction sites in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 and delays in shipping energy storage\\nproducts during the first three fiscal quarters of 2022.\\n\\nThe full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, such as\\nthe ultimate duration and scope of the pandemic, its impact on our employees, customers, and vendors, in addition to how quickly pre-pandemic economic\\nconditions and operations resume and whether the pandemic exacerbates other risks disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” within this Annual Report.\\n.\\n\\n2021 Cargo Loss Incident\\n\\nOn April 28, 2021, the Company was notified of an emergency aboard a vessel carrying Fluence inventory. This incident (the “Cargo Loss Incident”)\\nresulted in damage to a portion of our cargo aboard the vessel. The Company has recorded $13.0 million provision to its inventory as of September 30,\\n2021  based  on  the  net  realizable  value  of  cargo  that  was  destroyed.  During  fiscal  year  2022,  $13.0  million  of  inventory  was  written  off  against  the\\nprovision. In addition to the inventory losses, we have incurred and expect to incur incremental expenses related to the incident, primarily consisting of\\ninspection  costs,  project  cost  overruns  due  to  logistical  changes,  legal  fees,  fees  to  dispose  of  the  damaged  cargo,  and  additional  cost  to  replace  the\\ndamaged  cargo.  We  received  an  aggregate  of  $10.0  million  insurance  proceeds  related  to  non-disputed  claims,  $7.5  million  of  which  was  collected  in\\nOctober 2021 and the remaining $2.5 million was collected in April 2022.\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Overheating Event at Customer Facility\\n\\nOn September 4, 2021, a 300 MW energy storage facility owned by one of our customers experienced an overheating event. Fluence served as the\\nenergy storage technology provider and designed and installed portions of the facility, which was completed in fiscal year 2021. No injuries were reported\\nfrom the incident. The facility was taken offline as teams from Fluence, our customer, and the battery designer/manufacturer investigated the incident. Our\\ncustomer released initial findings in the second fiscal quarter of 2022 on what it contends is the root cause of the incident. At this time, Fluence cannot\\ncomment on or accept the customer’s stated findings. The customer’s stated findings, if ultimately confirmed and proven, could relate to certain scopes of\\nwork for which Fluence or its subcontractors could be responsible. The customer’s stated findings, however, could also relate to certain scopes of work for\\nwhich other parties were responsible and/or relate to other causes, including the design and installation of portions of the facility over which Fluence did\\nnot  have  responsibility  or  control.  The  customer  has  alleged  that  Fluence  is  liable  for  the  incident  but  has  not  yet  demanded  a  specific  amount  of\\ncompensation nor alleged a particular level of responsibility. Fluence has denied liability. No formal legal proceedings have been commenced, but it is\\nreasonably possible that litigation may result from this matter if a resolution cannot be achieved. Any such dispute would also likely include claims by\\nFluence  and  counterclaims  by  the  customer  relating  to  disputed  costs  arising  from  the  original  design  and  construction  of  the  facility.  The  customer\\nannounced in July of 2022 that a large portion of the facility was back online. We are currently not able to estimate the impact, that this incident may have\\non our financial results. To date, we do not believe that this incident has impacted the market’s adoption of our products.\\n\\n2022 Overheating Event at Customer Facility\\n\\nOn April 18, 2022, a 10 MW energy storage facility in Chandler, Arizona owned by AES experienced an overheating event. Fluence served as the\\nenergy storage technology provider for the facility, which was completed in 2019, and Fluence currently provides maintenance services for the facility.\\nThere were no injuries. The facility has been taken offline as teams from Fluence, AES, and the battery manufacturer investigate the incident. We are\\ncurrently not able to estimate the impact, if any, that this incident may have on our reputation or financial results, or on market adoption of our products.\\n\\nSegments\\n\\nThe Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company’s CODM reviews financial information on a\\nconsolidated  basis  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions,  allocating  resources,  and  evaluating  financial  performance.  As  such,  the  Company  has\\ndetermined that it operates in one operating segment, which corresponds to one reportable segment.\\n\\nKey Factors and Trends Affecting our Performance\\n\\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and\\n\\nchallenges, including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” within this Annual Report.\\n\\nLithium-ion Battery Cost\\n\\nOur revenue growth is directly tied to the continued adoption of energy storage products by our customers. The cost of lithium-ion energy storage\\n\\nhardware has declined significantly in the last decade and has resulted in a large addressable market today.\\n\\nHowever, according to BloombergNEF’s 2021 (issued November 2021) battery price survey, higher raw material costs could push the average price of\\na lithium-ion battery packs up in the short term, which would mark the first annual increase in price since at least 2010. BloombergNEF predicts battery\\nprices to decline again by 2024, although the timing of that decline could be pushed back by two years in the absence of improvements mitigating the short-\\nterm price increases. The market for energy storage is rapidly evolving, and while we believe costs will continue to decline over the long term, there is no\\nguarantee that they will decline or decline at the rates we expect, and the short-term increases predicted by BloombergNEF could be larger or last longer\\nthan they predict. If costs do not continue to decline long term, this could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenue or grow our business.\\n\\nIncreasing Deployment of Renewable Energy\\n\\nDeployment  of  renewable  energy  resources  has  accelerated  over  the  last  decade,  and  solar  and  wind  have  become  a  low-cost  energy  source.\\nBloombergNEF  estimates  that  renewable  energy  is  expected  to  represent  70%  of  all  new  global  capacity  installations  over  the  next  ten  years.  Energy\\nstorage  is  critical  to  reducing  the  intermittency  and  volatility  of  renewable  energy  generation.  However,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  deployment  of\\nrenewable energy will occur at the rate estimated by BloombergNEF. Inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, geo-political stresses such as the\\nRussia-Ukraine conflict, and other factors could result in fluctuations in demand for and deployment of renewable energy resources, adversely affecting our\\nrevenue and ability to generate profits in the future.\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Competition\\n\\nThe market for our products is competitive, and we may face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce energy storage solutions\\nand components. Furthermore, as we expand our services and digital applications in the future, we may face other competitors including software providers\\nand some hardware manufacturers that offer software solutions. If our market share declines due to increased competition or if we are not able to compete\\nas we expect, our revenue and ability to generate profits in the future may be adversely affected.\\n\\nSeasonality\\n\\nWe  have  historically  experienced  seasonality  and  see  increased  order  intake  in  our  third  and  fourth  fiscal  quarters  (April – September),  driven  by\\ndemand in the Northern Hemisphere to install energy storage products before the summer of the following year. Combined third and fourth fiscal quarter\\norder  intake  have  historically  accounted  for  80%  or  more  of  our  total  intake  each  year.  However,  as  we  and  the  market  matures  we  are  seeing  less\\nseasonality.  For  fiscal  year  2022  third  and  fourth  quarter  order  intake  accounted  for  only  48%  of  our  total  intake  for  the  year.  As  a  result,  revenue\\ngeneration is typically significantly stronger in our third and fourth fiscal quarters as we provide the majority of our products to customers during these\\nperiods. Cash flows historically have been negative in our first and second fiscal quarters, neutral to positive in our third fiscal quarter, and positive in our\\nfourth fiscal quarter. Our services and digital applications and solutions offerings do not experience the same seasonality given their recurring nature.\\n\\nInflation\\n\\nIn the markets in which we operate, there have been higher rates of inflation in recent months. If inflation continues to increase in our markets, it may\\nincrease our expenses that we may not be able to pass through to customers. It may also increase the costs of our products that could negatively impact their\\ncompetitiveness.\\n\\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\\n\\nThe following discussion describes certain line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and comprehensive loss.\\n\\nTotal Revenue\\n\\nWe generate revenue from the sale of energy storage products, service agreements with customers to provide operational services related to battery-\\nbased energy storage products, and from digital application contracts. Fluence enters into contracts with utility companies, developers, and commercial and\\nindustrial customers. We derive the majority of our revenues from selling energy storage products. When we sell a battery-based energy storage product,\\nwe enter into a contract with our customers covering the price, specifications, delivery dates and warranty for the products being purchased, among other\\nthings.\\n\\nOur revenue is affected by changes in the price, volume and mix of products and services purchased by our customers, which is driven by the demand\\nfor our products, geographic mix of our customers, strength of competitors’ product offerings, and availability of government incentives to the end-users of\\nour products.\\n\\nOur revenue growth is dependent on continued growth in the amount of battery-based energy storage products projects constructed each year and our\\nability to increase our share of demand in the geographic regions where we currently compete and plan to compete in the future as well as our ability to\\ncontinue to develop and commercialize new and innovative products that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers.\\n\\nCost of Goods and Services\\n\\nCost  of  goods  and  services  consists  primarily  of  product  costs,  including  purchased  materials  and  supplies,  as  well  as  costs  related  to  shipping,\\ncustomer  support,  product  warranty  and  personnel.  Personnel  costs  in  cost  of  goods  and  services  includes  both  direct  labor  costs  as  well  as  costs\\nattributable to any individuals whose activities relate to the transformation of raw materials or component parts into finished goods or the transportation of\\nmaterials to the customer.\\n\\nOur product costs are affected by the underlying cost of raw materials, including steel and aluminum supply costs, including inverters, casings, fuses,\\nand cable; technological innovation; economies of scale resulting in lower supply costs; and improvements in production processes and automation. We do\\nnot currently hedge against changes in the price of raw materials. We generally expect the ratio of cost of goods and services to revenue to decrease as sales\\nvolumes increase due to economies of scale, however, some of these costs, primarily personnel related costs, are not directly affected by sales volume.\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Gross Profit (Loss) and Gross Profit Margin\\n\\nGross profit (loss) and gross profit margin may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our sales volume, product prices, product\\n\\ncosts, product mix, customer mix, geographical mix, shipping method, warranty costs, and seasonality.\\n\\nOperating Expenses\\n\\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and\\namortization. Personnel-related expenses are the most significant component of our operating expenses and include salaries, stock-based compensation, and\\nemployee benefits. We expect to invest in additional resources to support our growth which will increase our operating expenses in the near future.\\n\\nResearch and Development Expenses\\n\\nResearch  and  development  expenses  consist  of  personnel-related  costs  across  our  global  R&D  centers  for  engineers  engaged  in  the  design  and\\ndevelopment and testing of our integrated products and technologies. Engineering competencies include data science, software development, network and\\ncyber security, battery systems engineering, industrial controls, UI / UX, mechanical design, and more. R&D expenses also support three product testing\\nlabs located across the globe, including a new system-level testing facility in Pennsylvania that will be used for quality assurance and the rapid iteration,\\ntesting, and launching of new Fluence energy storage technology and products. We expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods\\nto  support  our  growth  and  as  we  continue  to  invest  in  research  and  development  activities  that  are  necessary  to  achieve  our  technology  and  product\\nroadmap goals. These expenses may vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue, depending primarily upon when we choose to make more\\nsignificant investments.\\n\\nSales and Marketing Expenses\\n\\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, stock-based compensation, and employee benefits.\\n\\nWe intend to expand our sales presence and marketing efforts to additional countries in the future.\\n\\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\\n\\nGeneral  and  administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  personnel-related  expenses,  including  salaries,  stock-based  compensation,  and  employee\\nbenefits, for our executives, finance, human resources, information technology, engineering and legal organizations that do not relate directly to the sales or\\nresearch and development functions, as well as travel expenses, facilities costs, bad debt expense and fees for professional services. Professional services\\nconsist of audit, legal, tax, insurance, information technology and other costs.\\n\\nDepreciation and Amortization\\n\\nDepreciation consists of costs associated with property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) and amortization of intangibles consisting of patents, licenses,\\nand  developed  technology  over  their  expected  period  of  use.  We  expect  that  as  we  increase  both  our  revenues  and  the  number  of  our  general  and\\nadministrative personnel, we will invest in additional PP&E to support our growth resulting in additional depreciation and amortization.\\n\\nInterest Expense\\n\\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest previously incurred on our now extinguished Line of Credit and Promissory Notes (each as defined\\nbelow), unused line fees related to the revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) pursuant to a credit agreement by and among Fluence Energy, LLC, as the\\nborrower, Fluence Energy, Inc., as a parent guarantor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as\\nadministrative agent and collateral agent (the “Credit Agreement”), and amortization of debt issuance costs.\\n\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\n\\nOther income (expense), net consists of income (expense) from foreign currency exchange adjustments for monetary assets and liabilities.\\n\\nTax Expense\\n\\nHistorically, prior to the IPO, Fluence Energy, LLC was not subject to U.S. federal or state income tax. As such, Fluence Energy, LLC did not pay U.S.\\nfederal or state income tax, as taxable income or loss will be included in the U.S. tax returns of its members. Fluence Energy LLC was subject to income\\ntaxes, including withholding taxes, outside the U.S. and our income tax expense (benefit)\\n\\n56\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##on the consolidated statements of operations primarily relates to income taxes from foreign operations, withholding taxes on intercompany royalties and\\nchanges in valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. After our IPO, we are now subject to U.S. federal and state\\nincome taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income or loss of Fluence Energy, LLC, and are taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates.\\nWe will continue to be subject to foreign income taxes with respect to our foreign subsidiaries and our expectations are valuation allowances will be needed\\nin certain tax jurisdictions. In addition to tax expenses, we also will incur expenses related to our operations, as well as payments under the Tax Receivable\\nAgreement,  which  we  expect  could  be  significant  over  time.  We  will  receive  a  portion  of  any  distributions  made  by  Fluence  Energy,  LLC.  Any  cash\\nreceived from such distributions from our subsidiaries will be first used by us to satisfy any tax liability and then to make payments required under the Tax\\nReceivable Agreement.\\n\\nKey Operating Metrics\\n\\nThe following tables presents our key operating metrics and order intake for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

We start providing maintenance, monitoring, or other operational services after the storage product projects are completed.\\n\\nAssets under management for digital software represents contracts signed and active (post go live).\\n\\n57\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Contracted Backlog and Contracted\\n\\nFor our energy storage products contracts, contracted backlog includes signed customer orders or contracts under execution prior to when substantial\\ncompletion is achieved. For service contracts, contracted backlog includes signed service agreements associated with our storage product projects that have\\nnot been completed and the associated service has not started. For digital applications contracts, contracted backlog includes signed agreements where the\\nassociated subscription has not started.\\n\\nContracted represents new energy storage product contracts, new service contracts and new digital contracts signed during each fiscal year presented.\\n\\nPipeline\\n\\nPipeline represents our uncontracted, potential revenue from energy storage products, service, and digital software contracts, which have a reasonable\\nlikelihood of contract execution within 24 months. Pipeline is monitored by management to understand the anticipated growth of our Company and our\\nestimated future revenue related to customer contracts for our battery-based energy storage products and services.\\n\\nWe  cannot  guarantee  that  our  contracted  backlog  or  pipeline  will  result  in  actual  revenue  in  the  originally  anticipated  period  or  at  all.  Contracted\\nbacklog and pipeline may not generate margins equal to our historical operating results. We have only recently begun to track our contracted backlog and\\npipelines on a consistent basis as performance measures, and as a result, we do not have significant experience in determining the level of realization that\\nwe will achieve on these contracts. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result of external market factors and economic or\\nother  factors  beyond  our  control.  If  our  contracted  backlog  and  pipeline  fail  to  result  in  revenue  at  all  or  in  a  timely  manner,  we  could  experience  a\\nreduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity. Pipeline is an internal management metric that we construct from market information reported by our\\nglobal sales force.\\n\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nThis section contains references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross\\n\\nProfit Margin, Adjusted Net Loss, and Free Cash Flow.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated from the consolidated statements of operations using net income (loss) adjusted for (i) interest income (expense), net,\\n(ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) equity-based compensation, and (v) other income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA may in the\\nfuture also be adjusted for amounts impacting net income related to the Tax Receivable Agreement liability.\\n\\nAdjusted Gross Profit (Loss) is calculated using gross profit (loss), adjusted to exclude certain other income or expenses. Adjusted Gross Profit Margin\\n\\nis calculated using Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) divided by total revenue.\\n\\nAdjusted Net Loss is calculated using net loss, adjusted to exclude (i) amortization of intangibles, (ii) equity-based compensation, (iii) other income or\\n\\nexpenses, and (iv) tax impact of these adjustments.\\n\\nFree Cash Flow is calculated from the consolidated statements of cash flows and is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchase\\nof property and equipment made in the period. We expect our Free Cash Flow to fluctuate in future periods as we invest in our business to support our\\nplans for growth. Limitations on the use of Free Cash Flow include (i) it should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for\\ndiscretionary expenditures. For example, cash is still required to satisfy other working capital needs, including short-term investment policy, restricted cash,\\nand intangible assets; (ii) Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of\\nother GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities; and (iii) this metric does not reflect our future contractual commitments.\\n\\nThese  non-GAAP  measures  are  intended  as  supplemental  measures  of  performance  and/or  liquidity  that  are  neither  required  by,  nor  presented  in\\naccordance with, GAAP. We believe that such non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our operating results presented under GAAP, can be\\nused to better assess our performance from period to period and relative to performance of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing\\nmethods, historical cost basis or capital structure.\\n\\nThese non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and\\nmay not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. Readers are cautioned that these non-GAAP measures should not be construed as\\nalternatives to other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures and their reconciliation to GAAP\\nfinancial measures are shown below.\\n\\n58\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##The following tables present our non-GAAP measures for the periods indicated.\\n\\n($ in thousands)\\nNet loss\\nAdd (deduct):\\n\\nInterest expense (income), net\\nIncome tax expense\\nDepreciation and amortization\\nStock-based compensation\\n(b)\\nOther expenses\\nAdjusted EBITDA\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\nChange\\n\\n Change %\\n\\n(289,177) $\\n\\n(162,003) $\\n\\n(127,174)\\n\\n(326)\\n1,357 \\n7,108 \\n44,131 \\n52,674 \\n\\n(184,233) $\\n\\n1,429 \\n1,829 \\n5,112 \\n— \\n88,959 \\n(64,674) $\\n\\n(1,755)\\n(472)\\n1,996 \\n44,131 \\n(36,285)\\n(119,559)\\n\\n(78.5)%\\n\\n(122.8)\\n(25.8)\\n39.0 \\n100.0 \\n(40.8)\\n(184.9)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n(a) Included awards that will be settled in shares and awards that will be settled in cash.\\n(b) Amount in 2022 included $39.1 million of costs related to COVID-19 pandemic including excess shipping costs, project charges and other costs, a $11.9 million loss related to the Cargo Loss\\nIncident, $0.1 million IPO-related expenses which did not qualify for capitalization, and $1.6 million in Executive severance costs.

The $517.8 million or 76.1% increase was\\nmainly attributable to the expansion of sales of our battery energy storage products and solutions, particularly in the Americas and EMEA regions and our\\nability to execute on customer change orders that partially negated the impact of supply chain cost increases.\\n\\nCosts of Goods and Services\\n\\nCost of goods and services increased from $749.9 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1,261.0 million in fiscal year 2022. The $511.0 million, or 68.1%,\\nincrease was primarily attributable to materials and supplies associated with the sale of our battery energy storage products due to increased sales volume\\nwhich outpaced increases in costs of goods and services. In addition, cost of goods and services increased as a result of higher battery module prices passed\\non to us from our supplier.\\n\\nGross Profit (Loss) and Gross Profit Margin\\n\\nGross loss was $(62.4) million, and gross profit margin was negative (5.2)%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to a gross loss of $(69.1) million, and a\\ngross profit margin of negative (10.2)%, in fiscal year 2021. The gross loss in each of the fiscal years 2022 and 2021 have been negatively impacted by (i)\\ncapacity constraints within the shipping industry and increased shipping costs, both of which are caused primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\\n(ii) cost overruns, delays and other project charges we are experiencing in some projects currently under construction, and in deliveries our sixth-generation\\nproducts and (iii) the Cargo Loss Incident. In addition, we were negatively impacted in 2022 by higher battery module prices passed on to us from our\\nsupplier.\\n\\nResearch and Development Expenses\\n\\nResearch  and  development  expenses  increased  from  $23.4  million  in  fiscal  year  2021  to  $60.1  million  in  fiscal  year  2022.  The  $36.7  million,  or\\n156.7%,  increase  in  fiscal  year  2022  compared  to  fiscal  year  2021  was  mainly  related  to  increased  salaries  and  personnel-related  costs  due  to  higher\\nheadcount to support the growth of the Company, including $7.8 million of stock-based compensation expense.\\n\\nSales and Marketing Expenses\\n\\nSales and marketing expenses increased from $22.6 million in fiscal year 2021 to $37.2 million in fiscal year 2022. The increase of $14.6 million, or\\n\\n64.5%, is related to increased personnel-related expenses for our sales and marketing organization, consultants and other third-party vendors.\\n\\n60\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##General and Administrative Expenses\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $38.2 million in fiscal year 2021 to $116.7 million in fiscal year 2022. The increase of $78.5\\nmillion, or 205.8%, was mainly related to increases in personnel-related expenses, including $23.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, as well as\\nexpenses for outside professional services as we have been expanding our personnel headcount rapidly to support our growth.\\n\\nDepreciation and Amortization\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization increased from $5.1 million in fiscal year 2021 to $7.1 million in fiscal year 2022. The $2.0 million increase, or 39.0%,\\n\\nwas attributable to an increase of $1.0 million amortization related to intangible assets and $1.0 million depreciation from increased fixed assets.\\n\\nInterest expense\\n\\nInterest expense was $1.4 million in fiscal year 2021, compared to $2.0 million in fiscal year 2022. The $0.6 million increase, or 40.6%, was primarily\\n\\ndue to the increased amortization of Revolver deferred financing costs, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our Line of Credit.\\n\\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\\n\\nOther expense was $0.3 million in fiscal year 2021, compared to other expense of $2.3 million in fiscal year 2022. The $2.0 million increase, or\\n\\n744.8%, was mainly a result of foreign currency exchange adjustments for monetary assets and liabilities.\\n\\nIncome Tax Expense\\n\\nIncome tax expense decreased from $1.8 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1.4 million in fiscal year 2022. The effective income tax rate was (0.5)% and\\n(1.1)% for fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2021, respectively. The decrease in tax expense of $0.4 million and change in effective tax rate were primarily\\ndue to an increase in global pre-tax losses in fiscal year 2022. Additionally, during fiscal year 2022, there were non-taxable foreign exchange gains, as well\\nas changes in valuation allowances recorded.\\n\\nNet Loss\\n\\nNet loss increased from $162.0 million in fiscal year 2021 to $289.2 million in fiscal year 2022. The increase of $127.2 million, or 78.5%, was mainly\\ndriven by (i) capacity constraints within the shipping industry and increased shipping costs, both of which are caused primarily as a result of the COVID-19\\npandemic, (ii) cost overruns and delays we are experiencing in some projects currently under construction, (iii) the Cargo Loss Incident, (iv) higher battery\\nmodule prices and (v) increased expenses in general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development due to the expansion of our\\nbusiness and the build out of our corporate functions.\\n\\nComparison of the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2020\\n\\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, please see Item\\n7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\\nended September 30, 2021, filed with the SEC on December 14, 2021.\\n\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\n\\nSince inception and through September 30, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings, capital\\n\\ncontributions from AES Grid Stability and Siemens AG and affiliates, proceeds from the QFH investment and supply chain financing.\\n\\nOn November 1, 2021, upon the closing of our IPO, we received net proceeds of $935.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering\\nexpenses payable by the Company. The net proceeds from the IPO were used to purchase 35,650,000 newly issued LLC Interests directly from Fluence\\nEnergy, LLC at a price per unit equal to the IPO price per share of Class A common stock less the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses\\npayable by us. Fluence Energy, LLC used the net proceeds from the sale of LLC Interests to Fluence Energy, Inc. to repay all outstanding borrowings under\\nthe  now  extinguished  Line  of  Credit  and  the  Promissory  Notes.  The  remainder  of  the  proceeds  has  been  used  for  working  capital  and  other  general\\ncorporate purposes.\\n\\n61\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Prior to the IPO, the Company had an Uncommitted Line of Credit Agreement (“Line of Credit’) with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) which allowed us to\\nborrow an amount in aggregate not to exceed $50 million, with the expiration date on March 31, 2023. Outstanding borrowings from the Line of Credit\\nwere $50 million as of September 30, 2021. The weighted average annual interest rate of the borrowing was 2.83%. On November 1, 2021, the $50 million\\noutstanding borrowings from the Line of Credit was paid off using the proceeds from our IPO and the Line of Credit was canceled shortly thereafter.\\n\\nAdditionally,  prior  to  the  IPO,  we  funded  our  liquidity  through  borrowings  from  AES  Grid  Stability  and  Siemens  Industry.  On  August  11,  2021,\\nFluence Energy, LLC entered into a promissory note with each of Siemens Industry and AES Grid Stability, under which Fluence Energy, LLC received a\\nbridge financing of an aggregate of $50.0 million. In connection with the bridge financing, Fluence Energy, LLC issued a $25.0 million promissory note to\\neach  of  Siemens  Industry  and  AES  Grid  Stability  (together,  the  “Promissory  Notes”).  The  Promissory  Notes  bear  interest  at  a  rate  of  2.86%.  The\\nPromissory Notes were repaid on November 1, 2021 using proceeds from the IPO.\\n\\nWe  have  provided  certain  of  our  suppliers  with  access  to  a  supply  chain  financing  program  through  a  third-party  financing  institution  (the  “SCF\\nBank”). This program allows us to seek extended payment terms with our suppliers and allows our suppliers to monetize their receivables prior to the\\npayment due date, subject to a discount. Once a supplier elects to participate in the program and reaches an agreement with the SCF Bank, the supplier\\nelects which individual invoices to sell to the SCF Bank. We then pay the SCF Bank on the invoice due date. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s\\ndecision to sell a receivable to the SCF Bank. The agreements between our suppliers and the SCF Bank are solely at their discretion and are negotiated\\ndirectly between them. Our suppliers’ ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of our financial condition and\\nguarantees issued by AES and Siemens. As of September 30, 2021, AES and Siemens issued guarantees of $30.0 million each, for a total of $60.0 million,\\nto the SCF Bank on our behalf. SCF was further increased to $100.0 million on November 3, 2021 when AES and Siemens increased their guarantee to\\n$50.0 million each, for a total of $100 million As of September 30, 2022, three suppliers were actively participating in the supply chain financing program,\\nand we had $37.4 million of payables outstanding subject to the program. All outstanding payments owed under the program are recorded within Accounts\\npayable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n\\nInitial Public Offering\\n\\nOn November 1, 2021, the Company completed the IPO in which it issued and sold 35,650,000 shares of its Class A common stock at the public\\noffering  price  of  $28.00  per  share.  The  net  proceeds  to  the  Company  from  the  IPO  were  $935.8  million,  after  deducting  underwriting  discounts  and\\ncommissions and offering expenses payable by the Company. The net proceeds from the IPO have been used to purchase 35,650,000 newly issued LLC\\nInterests directly from Fluence Energy, LLC at a price per unit equal to the IPO price per share of Class A common stock less the underwriting discount\\nand estimated offering expenses payable by us. Fluence Energy, LLC used the net proceeds from the sale of LLC Interests to Fluence Energy, Inc. to repay\\nall outstanding borrowings under our existing Line of Credit and the Promissory Notes, and the remainder will be used for working capital and other\\ngeneral corporate purposes.\\n\\nRevolving Credit Facility\\n\\nWe entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement for a Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolver”) on November 1, 2021, by and among Fluence Energy,\\nLLC, as the borrower, Fluence Energy Inc., as a parent guarantor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and JP Morgan Chase\\nBank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Revolver is secured by a (i) first priority pledge of the equity securities of Fluence Energy,\\nLLC and its subsidiaries and (ii) first priority security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material\\nfee-owned real property of Fluence Energy, LLC, the parent guarantor and each subsidiary guarantor party thereto, in each case, subject to customary\\nexceptions and limitations. The initial aggregate amount of commitments is $190.0 million from the lenders party including JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.,\\nMorgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, and five other banks. On June 30, 2022, the Company increased the\\nrevolving  commitment  available  under  the  Revolver  by  $10.0  million  to  an  aggregate  of  $200.0  million  and  added  UBS  AG,  Stamford  Branch  as  an\\nadditional  lender  under  the  Revolver.  As  of  September  30,  2022,  the  aggregate  amount  of  commitments  is  $200.0  million.  The  maturity  date  of  the\\nRevolver is November 1, 2025.\\n\\nThe Revolver bears interests rate at either (i) the Adjusted LIBOR or Adjusted EURIBO Rate (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement)\\nplus 3.0 % or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus 2.0 % (subject to customary LIBOR replacement provisions\\nand alternative benchmark rates including customary spread adjustments with respect to borrowings in foreign currency), at the option of Fluence Energy,\\nLLC. Fluence Energy, LLC is required to pay to the lenders a commitment fee of 0.55 % per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving\\ncommitments  through  maturity,  which  will  be  the  four-year  anniversary  of  the  closing  date  of  the  Revolver.  The  Revolver  also  provides  for  up  to\\n$200.0 million in letter of credit issuances, which will require customary issuance and administration fees, as well as a fronting fee payable to each issuer\\nthereof and a letter of credit participation fee of 2.75 % per annum payable to the lenders.\\n\\n62\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##The Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, will restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness; incur liens; sell,\\ntransfer, or dispose of property and assets; make investments or acquisitions; make dividends, distributions, or other restricted payments; and engage in\\naffiliate transactions. The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement limit our ability to make certain payments, including dividends and distributions on\\nFluence Energy, LLC’s equity, Fluence Energy, Inc.’s equity and other restricted payments. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, Fluence\\nEnergy, LLC and its subsidiaries are currently limited in their ability to pay cash dividends to, lend to, or make other investments in Fluence Energy, Inc.,\\nsubject  to  certain  exceptions,  including  among  others  (i)  the  ability  to  make  investments  of  up  to  the  greater  of  (a)  $10,500,000  and  (b)  1.5%  of  the\\nconsolidated assets of Fluence Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and (ii) the ability to issue dividends and make other Restricted Payments (as defined in the\\nRevolving  Credit  Agreement)  (a)  if  after  giving  pro  forma  effect  to  such  dividend  or  other  Restricted  Payment  the  Total  Liquidity  (as  defined  in  the\\nRevolving Credit Agreement) of Fluence Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries party to the Revolving Credit Agreement is at least $600,000,000, or (b) such\\ndividend or other Restricted Payment is made to reimburse Fluence Energy, Inc. for certain tax distributions under the Fluence Energy LLC Agreement and\\ncertain payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and certain operational expenses incurred in connection with the ownership and management of\\nFluence Energy, LLC. In addition, we are required to maintain (i) minimum liquidity and gross revenue requirements, in each case, until consolidated\\nEBITDA reaches $150.0 million for the most recent four fiscal quarters and we make an election, and (ii) thereafter, a maximum total leverage ratio and a\\nminimum interest coverage ratio. Such covenants will be tested on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all such\\ncovenants or maintained availability above such covenant triggers.\\n\\nTax Receivable Agreement\\n\\nIn connection with the IPO, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with Fluence Energy, LLC and the Founders which obligates the Company\\nto make payments to the Founders of 85% of the amount of certain tax benefits that Fluence Energy, Inc. actually realizes, or in some circumstances is\\ndeemed  to  realize,  arising  from  the  Basis  Adjustments  (as  defined  below)  and  certain  other  tax  benefits  arising  from  payments  made  under  the  Tax\\nReceivable Agreement. Fluence Energy, LLC will have in effect an election under Section 754 of the Code effective for each taxable year in which a\\nredemption or exchange (including deemed exchange) of LLC Interests for Class A common stock or cash occurs or when Fluence Energy, LLC makes (or\\nis deemed to make) certain distributions. These Tax Receivable Agreement payments are not conditioned upon one or more of the Founders maintaining a\\ncontinued ownership interest in Fluence Energy, LLC. If a Founder transfers LLC Interests but does not assign to the transferee of such units its rights\\nunder the Tax Receivable Agreement, such Founder generally will continue to be entitled to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement arising\\nin respect of a subsequent exchange of such LLC Interests. In general, the Founders’ rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement may not be assigned, sold,\\npledged,  or  otherwise  alienated  or  transferred  to  any  person,  other  than  certain  permitted  transferees,  without  our  prior  written  consent  (not  to  be\\nunreasonably withheld) and such person’s becoming a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement and agreeing to succeed to the applicable Founder’s interest\\ntherein.\\n\\nRedemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests post-IPO are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the assets of Fluence Energy, LLC and\\ncertain  of  its  subsidiaries.  Increases  in  tax  basis  and  tax  basis  adjustments  generated  over  time  may  increase  (for  tax  purposes)  the  depreciation  and\\namortization deductions available to Fluence Energy, Inc. and, therefore, may reduce the amount of U.S. federal, state, and local tax that Fluence Energy,\\nInc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of the validity of that tax basis, and a court could sustain\\nsuch a challenge. Fluence Energy, Inc.’s allocable share of tax basis and the anticipated tax basis adjustments upon redemptions or exchanges of LLC\\nInterests may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those assets. Actual tax\\nbenefits realized by Fluence Energy, Inc. may differ from tax benefits calculated under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of the use of certain\\nassumptions in the Tax Receivable Agreement, including the use of an assumed state and local income tax rate to calculate tax benefits. The payment\\nobligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement is an obligation of Fluence Energy, Inc. and not of Fluence Energy, LLC. We expect to use distributions\\nfrom Fluence Energy, LLC to fund any payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent we are unable to\\nmake timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid;\\nprovided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement\\nresulting in the acceleration of payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Fluence Energy, Inc. expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash\\ntax benefits, if any, it realizes from such tax benefits. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the cash tax benefits will be computed by comparing\\nthe actual income tax liability of Fluence Energy, Inc. to the amount of such taxes that Fluence Energy, Inc. would have been required to pay had there been\\nno such tax basis adjustments of the assets of Fluence Energy, LLC or its subsidiaries as a result of redemptions or exchanges and had Fluence Energy, Inc.\\nnot entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. The actual and hypothetical tax liabilities determined in the Tax Receivable Agreement will be calculated\\nusing the actual U.S. federal income tax rate in effect for the applicable period and an assumed state and local income tax rate (along with the use of certain\\nother  assumptions).  The  term  of  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  will  continue  until  all  such  tax  benefits  have  been  utilized  or  expired,  unless  Fluence\\nEnergy, Inc. exercises its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, certain changes of control occur or Fluence Energy, Inc. breaches any of\\nits material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, in which case, all obligations generally (and in the case of such a change of control or such\\nbreach, only if the Founders elect) will be accelerated and due as if Fluence Energy, Inc. had exercised its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement.\\nThe payment to be made upon an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally equal the present value of payments to be made under\\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement using certain assumptions. Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement is by\\nits nature\\n\\n63\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. The tax basis adjustments upon the redemption or exchange of\\nLLC Interests, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors,\\nincluding the timing of purchases or exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the purchase or exchange, the extent to\\nwhich such purchases or exchanges do not result in a basis adjustment, the amount of tax attributes, changes in tax rates and the amount and timing of our\\nincome.\\n\\nOn June 30, 2022, Siemens Industry, Inc. exercised its redemption right pursuant to the terms of LLC Agreement with respect to its entire holding of\\n58,586,695 LLC Interests of Fluence Energy, LLC, together with the corresponding cancellation of an equivalent number of shares of Class B-1 common\\nstock of Fluence Energy, Inc., par value $0.00001 per share (the “Redemption”). The Redemption resulted in increases in the tax basis of the assets of\\nFluence Energy, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries. The increases in tax basis and tax basis adjustments increases (for tax purposes) the depreciation and\\namortization deductions available to Fluence Energy, Inc. and, therefore, may reduce the amount of U.S. federal, state, and local tax that Fluence Energy,\\nInc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of the validity of that tax basis, and a court could sustain\\nsuch a challenge.\\n\\nWe expect that as a result of the tax basis adjustment of the assets of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries upon the Redemption and our possible\\nutilization of certain tax attributes, the payments that we may make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. As a result of the Redemption,\\nwe estimate tax savings of approximately $109.6 million. Siemens AG will be entitled to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement equaling\\n85%  of  such  amount,  or  $93.1  million;  assuming,  among  other  factors,  (i)  we  will  have  sufficient  taxable  income  to  fully  utilize  the  tax  benefits;  (ii)\\nFluence Energy, LLC is able to fully depreciate or amortize its assets; and (iii) no material changes in applicable tax law. The payments under the Tax\\nReceivable Agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of us by the Founders. Although the timing and extent of future payments could vary\\nsignificantly under the Tax Receivable Agreement for the factors discussed above, we anticipate funding payments from the Tax Receivable Agreement\\nfrom cash flow from operations of our subsidiaries, available cash or available borrowings under any future debt agreements, and such payments are not\\nanticipated to be dependent upon the availability of proceeds of the IPO.\\n\\nPrior  to  the  Redemption,  we  determined  it  was  not  probable  payments  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  would  be  made,  given  there  was  no\\nexpectation of future sufficient taxable income over the term of the agreement to utilize deductions in the future. Therefore, the Company did not initially\\nrecognize the liability. Upon the Redemption, the Company still determines that it is not probable payment under the agreement would be made and has not\\nrecognized  the  change  in  the  liability.  Should  we  determine  that  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  payment  is  probable,  a  corresponding  liability  will  be\\nrecorded. As a result, our future results of operations and earnings could be impacted as a result of these matters.\\n\\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, short-term borrowing, and recent investments from QIA through\\nQFH, combined with the proceeds of our IPO, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the next twelve\\nmonths following the filing of this Annual Report.\\n\\nCredit Support and Reimbursement Agreement\\n\\nWe are party to an Amended and Restated Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement with AES and Siemens Industry whereby they may, from\\ntime to time, agree to furnish credit support to us in the form of direct issuances of credit support to our lenders or other beneficiaries or through their\\nlenders’ provision of letters of credit to backstop our own facilities or obligations. Pursuant to the Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement, if AES\\nor Siemens Industry agree to provide a particular credit support (which they are permitted to grant or deny in their sole discretion), they are entitled to\\nreceipt of a credit support fee and reimbursement for all amounts paid to our lenders or other counterparties, payable upon demand. The Credit Support and\\nReimbursement Agreement will not provide any credit support from September 30, 2026, provided that either AES or Siemens Industry will be permitted\\nto terminate the agreement upon six months prior notice.\\n\\nHistorical Cash Flows\\n\\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods presented.\\n\\n($ in thousands)\\nNet cash used in operating activities\\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\\nNet cash provided by financing activities\\n\\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\nChange\\n\\nChange %\\n\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n\\n(282,385) $\\n(148,417) $\\n817,053  $\\n\\n(265,269)\\n(22,292)\\n231,126 \\n\\n(17,116)\\n(126,125)\\n585,927 \\n\\n(6.5)%\\n565.8 %\\n253.5 %\\n\\n64\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Net cash flows used in operating activities were $282.4 million in fiscal year 2022 compared $265.3 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase in net\\n\\noperating cash outflows was mainly due to the increase in receivables, partially offset by increased accounts payables.\\n\\nNet  cash  flows  used  in  investing  activities  was  $148.4  million  in  fiscal  year  2022,  which  included  $110.1  million  for  the  purchase  of  short-term\\ninvestments, $29.2 million related to cash paid for a business acquisition, and $7.9 million purchases of property and equipment. Net cash flows used in\\ninvesting activities was $22.3 million in fiscal year 2021, which included $18.0 million related to the business acquisition and $4.3 million of purchases of\\nproperty and equipment.\\n\\nCash flows provided by financing activities of $817.1 million in fiscal year 2022 was primarily driven by $948.0 of proceeds from issuance of Class A\\ncommon stock sold in an IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, offset by $50.0 million repayment of promissory notes and $50.0 million\\nrepayment of line of credit. Cash flows provided by financing activities of $231.1 million in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to $125.0 million proceeds\\nfrom issuance of Class B membership units to QFH, $6.3 million capital contribution from Siemens Industry, $50.0 million net borrowings under the Line\\nof Credit, and $50.0 million net borrowings from the Promissory Notes.\\n\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\\n\\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the preparation of these financial statements, we consider an accounting\\njudgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the\\nuse  of  different  judgments,  estimates,  and  assumptions  could  have  a  material  impact  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  We  believe  that  the\\naccounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas\\ninvolving management’s judgments and estimates.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nWe determine our revenue recognition through the following steps: (i) identification of the contract or contracts with a customer, (ii) identification of\\nthe  performance  obligations  within  the  contract,  (iii)  determination  of  the  transaction  price,  (iv)  allocation  of  the  transaction  price  to  the  performance\\nobligations within the contract, and (v) recognition of revenue as the performance obligation has been satisfied.\\n\\nOur  revenue  was  generated  primarily  from  sale  of  battery-based  energy  storage  products,  providing  operational  services  related  to  energy  storage\\n\\nproducts, and providing digital applications and solutions.\\n\\nSale of Energy Storage Products\\n\\nThe Company enters into contracts with utility companies, developers, and C&I customers to design and build battery-based energy storage products.\\nEach  storage  product  is  customized  depending  on  the  customer’s  energy  needs.  Customer  payments  are  due  upon  meeting  certain  milestones  that  are\\nconsistent with contract-specific phases of a project. We determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received which includes\\nestimates for project execution risks and other variable considerations, including liquidated damages. The transaction price identified is allocated to each\\ndistinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service based on the relative standalone selling prices. Generally, our contracts to design and build\\nbattery-based storage solutions are determined to have one performance obligation. We believe that the prices negotiated with each individual customer are\\nrepresentative of the stand-alone selling price of the energy storage products.\\n\\nWe  recognize  revenue  over  time  as  a  result  of  the  continuous  transfer  of  control  of  our  energy  storage  products  to  the  customer.  This  continuous\\ntransfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contracts that provide enforceable rights to payment of the transaction price associated\\nwith work performed to date and is for products that do not have an alternative use to us and/or the project is built on the customer’s land that is under the\\ncustomer’s control.\\n\\nRevenue from the contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract\\ncosts.  Standard  inventory  materials  that  could  be  used  interchangeably  on  other  projects  are  not  included  in  our  measure  of  progress  until  they  are\\nintegrated  into,  or  restricted  to,  the  production  of  the  customer’s  asset.  Contract  costs  include  all  direct  material  and  labor  costs  related  to  contract\\nperformance.  Pre-contract  costs  with  no  future  benefit  are  expensed  in  the  period  in  which  they  are  incurred.  Since  the  revenue  recognition  of  these\\ncontracts depends on estimates, which are assessed continually during the term of the contract, recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as\\nthe  contract  progresses  to  completion.  The  cumulative  effects  of  revisions  of  estimated  total  contract  costs  and  revenues,  together  with  any  contract\\nreserves  which  may  be  deemed  appropriate,  are  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  facts  and  changes  in  circumstance  become  known.  Due  to  the\\nuncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that these estimates will be revised in a different period. When a loss is forecasted\\nfor a contract, the full amount of the anticipated loss is recognized in the period in which it is determined that a loss will occur.\\n\\n65\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Our contracts generally provide our customers the right to liquidated damages (“LDs”) against Fluence in the event specified milestones are not met on\\ntime, or equipment is not delivered according to contract specifications. LDs are accounted for as variable consideration, and the contract price is reduced\\nby the expected penalty or LD amount when recognizing revenue. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is\\nprobable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Estimating variable\\nconsideration requires certain estimates and assumptions, including whether and by how much a project will be delayed and/or will not meet performance\\ncontractual  specifications.  The  existence  and  measurement  of  liquidated  damages  may  also  be  impacted  by  our  judgements  about  the  probability  of\\nfavorable outcomes of customer disputes involving whether certain events qualify as force majeure or the reason for the events that caused project delays.\\nVariable consideration for liquidated damages is estimated using the expected value of the consideration to be received. If Fluence has a claim against the\\ncustomer for amount not specified in the contract, such claim is recognized as an increase to contract price when it is legally enforceable, which is usually\\nupon signing a respective change order or equivalent document confirming the claim acceptance by customer.\\n\\nServices\\n\\nThe Company also enters into long-term service agreements with customers to provide operational services related to purchased battery-based energy\\nstorage products. The services include maintenance, monitoring, and other minor services. We account for the services as a single performance obligation\\nas the services are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customers. We recognize revenue over time using a straight-line\\nrecognition method for these types of services. We believe using a time-based method to measure progress is appropriate as the performance obligations are\\nsatisfied evenly over time based on the fact that customers receive the services evenly and the cost pattern does not change significantly over the service\\nperiod. Revenue is recognized by dividing the total transaction price over the service period.\\n\\nSome  of  the  agreements  also  provide  a  commitment  to  perform  augmentation  activities  which  would  typically  be  represented  by  installation  of\\nadditional batteries, and other components as needed, to compensate for partially lost capacity due to degradation of batteries over time. The obligation to\\nperform augmentation activities can take the form of either maintaining battery capacity above a given threshold for a stated term while others provide a\\nfixed  number  of  augmentations  over  a  contract  term.  Augmentation  arrangements  that  require  us  to  maintain  battery  capacity  above  an  established\\nthresholds  for  a  given  term  are  considered  service-type  warranties.  These  represent  a  stand-ready  obligation  in  which  the  customer  benefits  evenly\\novertime. We recognize revenue for these arrangements using a straight-line recognition method. Alternatively, augmentation arrangements that require us\\nto  perform  a  fixed  number  of  augmentations  over  a  contract  term  follow  the  percentage  of  completion  revenue  recognition  method.  Since  these\\narrangements require a fixed number of augmentations we must perform, we use the pattern of cost as a proxy to identify when our obligations are satisfied\\nand to recognize revenue.\\n\\nFor both products and service contracts where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the\\nvarious obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs\\nplus margin or using market data for comparable products when estimated costs are not imputable.\\n\\nDigital Applications and Solutions\\n\\nIn October 2020, Fluence Energy, LLC acquired the AMS software and digital intelligence platform, which became the Fluence Trading Platform.\\nContracts  involving  the  Fluence  Trading  Platform  are  generally  entered  into  with  commercial  entities  that  control  utility-scale  storage  and  renewable\\ngeneration assets. Fluence Trading Platform arrangements consist of a promise to provide access to proprietary cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”)\\nto promote enhanced financial returns on the utility-scale storage and renewable generation assets. The Fluence Trading Platform is a hosted service that\\ndelivers automated, market-compliant bids to local electricity market operators. Customers do not receive legal title or ownership of the software as a result\\nof these arrangements. The term of Fluence’s contracts with Trading Platform customers is generally five years, which may include certain renewal options\\nto extend the initial contract term or certain termination options to reduce the initial contract term.\\n\\nThe Fluence Trading Platform is technology- and vendor-agnostic (i.e. it can be utilized for wind and solar assets as well as non-Fluence systems). The\\nFluence  Trading  Platform  is  separately  identifiable  from  other  promises  that  the  Company  offers  to  its  customers  (i.e.  it  is  not  highly  interrelated  or\\nintegrated with other solutions). As such, we determined that the Fluence Trading Platform should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.\\nRevenue from the Fluence Trading Platform includes an integration fee and a monthly subscription fee. We consider the access to the Fluence Trading\\nPlatform and related support services in a customer contract to be a series of distinct services which comprise a single performance obligation because they\\nare substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. We recognized revenue overtime using a straight-line recognition method.\\n\\nIn April 2022, Fluence Energy, LLC acquired Nispera, which is a Zurich-based provider of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-enabled\\n\\nsoftware-as-a-service (SaaS) targeting the renewable energy sector.\\n\\n66\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##In combination with Fluence IQ’s digital application offerings, Nispera’s suite of five applications will enable the combined firm to offer its customers\\n\\na user-centric “manage app” to ultimately lower the cost of owning renewable and energy storage assets for our customers. In addition to its core SaaS\\nproduct, Nispera’s technology portfolio includes a predictive maintenance app, an operations and maintenance app, and a portfolio management app. The\\ncompany also offers a fifth application that provides enhanced power generation forecasting services for energy assets that is particularly attractive to\\nenergy traders, large asset managers, grid operators, and financial institutions. Similar to AMS, Nispera’s SaaS and related support services in a customer\\ncontract are assessed to be a series of distinct services which comprise a single performance obligation because they are substantially the same and have the\\nsame pattern of transfer. We recognized revenue overtime using a straight-line recognition method.\\n\\nRefer to Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates for further discussion of other critical accounting policies and estimates\\n\\nincluding income taxes, goodwill, and loss contracts.\\n\\nEmerging Growth Company Status\\n\\nWe are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. As an emerging growth company, we may take\\nadvantage of certain reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. We currently intend to take advantage of\\nseveral of these reduced reporting requirements; however for the year-ended September 30, 2022, we “opted out” of the extended transition periods for\\ncomplying with new or revised accounting standards. This irrevocable decision requires us to comply with the financial accounting standard effective dates\\napplicable to non-emerging growth companies.\\n\\n67\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\\n\\nMarket  risk  is  the  potential  loss  that  may  result  from  market  changes  associated  with  our  business  or  with  an  existing  or  forecasted  financial\\n\\ntransactions. We are exposed to various market risks in the ordinary course of our business which are discussed below.\\n\\nCredit Risk\\n\\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations resulting in a loss to us. Our counterparties for sale of our\\nenergy  storage  products  and  delivery  service  are  customers  including  conglomerates,  utilities  /  load-serving  entities,  independent  power  producers,\\ndevelopers, and C&I customers in the United States and other countries. A loss of one or more of our significant customers, their inability to perform under\\ntheir contracts, or their default in payment could harm our business and negatively impact revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. Credit policies\\nhave  been  approved  and  implemented  to  govern  our  portfolio  of  counterparties  with  the  objective  of  mitigating  credit  losses.  These  policies  establish\\nguidelines,  controls,  and  limits  to  manage  credit  risk  within  approved  tolerances  by  mandating  an  appropriate  evaluation  of  the  financial  condition  of\\nexisting  and  potential  counterparties,  monitoring  agency  credit  ratings,  and  by  implementing  credit  practices  that  limit  exposure  according  to  the  risk\\nprofiles of the counterparties. In addition, customers are required to make milestone payments based on their project’s progress. We may also, at times,\\nrequire letters of credit, parent guarantees or cash collateral when deemed necessary.\\n\\nOur overall exposure may be affected positively or negatively by macroeconomic or regulatory changes that impact our counterparties to one extent or\\nanother. As of September 30, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our credit risk exposure to our counterparties. Currently,\\nmanagement  does  not  anticipate  a  material  adverse  effect  in  our  financial  position  or  results  of  operations  as  a  consequence  of  counterparty  non-\\nperformance. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of all our counterparties.\\n\\nForeign Currency Risk\\n\\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, while certain of our current subsidiaries have other functional currencies, reflecting their principal operating\\nmarkets. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, and the Swiss Franc in our\\ncurrent foreign markets could create significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. To date, we have not had material exposure to foreign currency\\nfluctuations and have not had material hedging instruments to hedge the foreign currency risks.\\n\\nCommodity Price Risk\\n\\nWe are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, including steel, aluminum and lithium, that are used in the\\ncomponents from suppliers that are inputs into our products. Prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other logistic costs\\nmarket factors from time to time. As we are not the direct buyer of these raw materials, we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity\\nrisk. Significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if suppliers increase component prices and we are unable to\\nrecover such increases from our customers and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n\\nCustomer Concentration and Emerging Market Exposure Risk\\n\\nWe deliver products and services in developed economies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Chile, Ireland, Switzerland, Australia,\\nGermany, and other developed countries. We also deliver products and services in the Philippines, which represent 6% and 20% of revenue for the fiscal\\nyear 2022 and 2021, respectively. Macroeconomic conditions in developing economies are usually more volatile than in developed economies and entail\\ncertain  risks  and  uncertainties.  Changes  in  the  United  States  trade  environment,  including  the  imposition  of  import  tariffs,  could  adversely  affect  the\\namount or timing of our revenues, results of operations or cash flows. The interruption of the flow of components and materials from international vendors\\ncould disrupt our supply chain, including as a result of the imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges on imports and exports.\\n\\nInterest Rate Risk\\n\\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under the Revolver, which bears interest at floating rates. We entered into the\\nRevolver on November 1, 2021, which bears a variable interest rate based on the Adjusted LIBOR, the Adjusted EURIBO Rate or the Alternate Base Rate\\n(each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement). As of September 30, 2022, we have no borrowings under the Revolver.\\n\\n68\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ITEM 8.

(the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related\\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity, members’ equity (deficit) and mezzanine equity and cash\\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at\\nItem 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all\\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\\nthree years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\n\\nBasis for Opinion\\n\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\\nstatements  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)\\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\n\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor\\nwere we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of\\ninternal  control  over  financial  reporting  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company\\'s  internal  control  over\\nfinancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\\n\\nOur  audits  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and\\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in\\nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\n\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\\n\\nTysons, VA\\n\\nDecember 13,

Organization and Operations\\n\\nFluence Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“the Company”), was formed on June 21, 2021. We conduct our business operations through Fluence\\nEnergy, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Fluence Energy, LLC was formed on June 30, 2017 as a joint venture between Siemens Industry, Inc.\\n(“Siemens Industry”), an indirect subsidiary of Siemens AG (“Siemens”), and AES Grid Stability, LLC (“AES Grid Stability”), an indirect subsidiary of\\nthe AES Corporation (“AES”), and commenced operations on January 1, 2018. We refer to Siemens Industry and AES Grid Stability as the “Founders” in\\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Report”).\\n\\nUpon the completion of our IPO on November 1, 2021, Fluence Energy, Inc. became a holding company whose sole material assets are the LLC\\nInterests in Fluence Energy LLC. All of our business is conducted through Fluence Energy, LLC, together with its subsidiaries, and the financial results of\\nFluence Energy, LLC will be consolidated in our financial statements. Fluence Energy LLC is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and,\\nas  a  result,  its  members,  including  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  will  pay  income  taxes  with  respect  to  their  allocable  shares  of  its  net  taxable  income.  As  of\\nSeptember 30, 2022, Fluence Energy, LLC had subsidiaries including Fluence Energy GmbH in Germany, Fluence Energy Pty Ltd. in Australia, Fluence\\nEnergy Inc. in the Philippines, Fluence Energy Chile SpA in Chile, Fluence Energy B.V. in Netherlands, Fluence Energy Global Production Operation LLC\\nin the US, Fluence BESS India Private Ltd in India, Nispera AG in Switzerland, and other subsidiaries yet to commence operations. Except where the\\ncontent clearly indicates otherwise, reference to “Fluence,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “the Company” refers to Fluence Energy, Inc. and all of its direct and\\nindirect subsidiaries, including Fluence Energy, LLC. When used in a historical context that is prior to the completion of the IPO, “we,” “us,” “our” or “the\\nCompany” refer to Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries.\\n\\nOur fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. References to “fiscal year 2020”, “fiscal year 2021” and “fiscal year 2022” refer to the\\n\\nfiscal years ended September 30, 2020, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\\n\\nThe Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company’s CODM reviews financial information on a\\nconsolidated  basis  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions,  allocating  resources,  and  evaluating  financial  performance.  As  such,  the  Company  has\\ndetermined that it operates in one operating segment, which corresponds to one reportable segment.\\n\\nQFH’s Investment in Fluence Energy, LLC\\n\\nOn December 27, 2020, Fluence Energy, LLC entered into an agreement with QIA Florence Holdings LLC (“QFH” or the “Blocker Company”) for a\\n$125.0 million investment and in exchange, QFH was issued 18,493,275 Class B units of Fluence Energy, LLC. QFH is an affiliate of the Qatar Investment\\nAuthority  (“QIA”),  the  sovereign  wealth  fund  of  Qatar,  and  its  subsidiaries  and  affiliates.  At  September  30,  2021,  the  investment  was  recognized  at\\ncarrying  value  within  mezzanine  equity  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  As  part  of  the  transactions  related  to  our  initial  public  offering  closed  on\\nNovember 1, 2021, QFH elected to convert their Class B units to the common stock of Fluence Energy, Inc., which was a conversion available to all of the\\nholders of Fluence Energy, LLC Class A and Class B units. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2022, no mezzanine equity is recorded on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets.\\n\\nInitial Public Offering and Related Transactions\\n\\nOn November 1, 2021, the Company completed an initial public offering (the “IPO”) and a series of organization transactions (collectively with the\\nIPO, the “Transactions”), in which the Company issued and sold 35,650,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Class\\nA  common  stock”),  at  the  public  offering  price  of  $28.00  per  share,  which  includes  the  exercise  by  the  underwriters  of  their  option  to  purchase  an\\nadditional  4,650,000  shares  of  the  Class  A  common  stock.  The  net  proceeds  to  the  Company  from  the  IPO  were  $935.8  million,  after  deducting\\nunderwriting discounts and offering expenses paid by the Company.\\n\\nImmediately following the consummation of the Transactions:\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nFluence  Energy,  Inc.  became  a  holding  company.  As  the  sole  managing  member  of  Fluence  Energy,  LLC,  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  controls  the\\nbusiness and affairs of Fluence Energy, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries;\\n\\nFluence Energy, Inc. owned, directly or indirectly, 54,143,275 limited liability company interests in Fluence Energy, LLC (the “LLC Interests”),\\nrepresenting approximately 31.6% of the economic interest in Fluence Energy, LLC;\\n\\nthe Founders owned 117,173,390 LLC Interests in Fluence Energy, LLC, representing approximately 68.4% of the economic interest in Fluence\\nEnergy, LLC;\\n\\n78\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##•\\n\\nthe investors in our IPO owned 35,650,000 shares of Class A common stock of Fluence Energy, Inc., representing approximately 65.8% of the\\neconomic interest in Fluence Energy, Inc.;\\n\\n• Qatar Holding LLC, the owner of the original Blocker Company, owned 18,493,275 shares of Class A common stock of Fluence Energy, Inc.,\\n\\nrepresenting approximately 34.2% of the economic interest in Fluence Energy, Inc.; and\\n\\n•\\n\\nthe Founders owned 117,173,390 shares of Class B-1 common stock of Fluence Energy, Inc.\\n\\nSiemens Industry Redemption\\n\\nOn June 30, 2022, Siemens Industry, Inc. exercised its redemption right pursuant to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability\\nCompany Agreement of Fluence Energy, LLC (the “LLC Agreement”) with respect to its entire holding of 58,586,695 LLC Interests of Fluence Energy,\\nLLC,  together  with  the  corresponding  cancellation  of  an  equivalent  number  of  shares  of  Class  B-1  common  stock  of  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.,  par  value\\n$0.00001 per share (the “Redemption”).\\n\\nThe Company elected to settle the Redemption through the issuance of 58,586,695 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Shares”).\\n\\nThe Redemption settled on July 7, 2022.\\n\\nThe Redemption increased the beneficial ownership interest of the Company in Fluence Energy, LLC to 66.08% as of June 30, 2022. The impact of the\\nchange in ownership interest did not result in a change in control. The Redemption been accounted for as an equity transaction and the carrying amount of\\nnon-controlling interest has been adjusted. Refer to Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, members’ equity (deficit) and mezzanine\\nequity included herein.\\n\\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n\\nPrinciples of Accounting and Consolidation\\n\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and\\nunder the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the\\naccounts of Fluence Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\n\\nNon-Controlling Interest\\n\\nAs the sole managing member of Fluence Energy, LLC, Fluence Energy, Inc. operates and controls all the business and affairs of Fluence Energy, LLC\\nand, through Fluence Energy, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, conducts the Company’s business. Fluence Energy, LLC is a variable interest\\nentity, of which Fluence Energy, Inc. beneficially owns a 66.22% interest as of September 30, 2022. For accounting purposes, Fluence Energy, Inc. is\\nconsidered the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates the results of Fluence Energy, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Prior to the IPO,\\nFluence Energy, Inc. had no operations and had no assets or liabilities. Accordingly, financial results, balances, and other information included herein for\\nperiods prior to the IPO are reflective of Fluence Energy, LLC.\\n\\nUse of Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\\naffect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from\\nthose  estimates.  Items  subject  to  such  estimates  and  assumptions  include:  the  valuation  of  acquired  and  assumed  liabilities  for  business  acquired,  the\\nrelative fair value allocations to contingencies with multiple elements, the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets; impairment of\\ngoodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets; valuation allowances for inventories; deferred tax assets; revenue recognized under the percentage-of-\\ncompletion  method;  accrued  bonuses;  and  various  project  related  provisions  including  but  not  limited  to  estimated  losses,  warranty  obligations,  and\\nliquidated damages.\\n\\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on-hand and highly liquid investments readily convertible to cash, with an original maturity of 90 days or less\\n\\nwhen purchased.\\n\\nCash restricted for use as a result of financing or other obligations is classified separately as restricted cash. If the purpose of restricted cash relates to\\nacquiring a long-term asset, liquidating a long-term liability, or is otherwise unavailable for a period longer than one year from the balance sheet date, the\\nrestricted cash is included in other long-term assets. Otherwise, restricted cash is included as a separate line item on the Company’s consolidated balance\\nsheets.\\n\\n79\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as shown in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\nin thousands\\nCash and cash equivalents\\nRestricted cash\\nRestricted cash included in “Other non-current assets”\\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the statements of cash flows\\n\\nRestricted cash consisted of the following:\\n\\nin thousands\\n\\nCollateral for credit card program\\nCollateral for outstanding bank guarantees\\nCollateral for surety program included in “Other non-current assets”\\nTotal restricted cash\\n\\nReceivables\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2022\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2021\\n\\n357,296  $\\n62,425 \\n10,000  $\\n429,721  $\\n\\n36,829 \\n1,240 \\n— \\n38,069 \\n\\nSeptember 30, 2022\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2021\\n\\n1,580  $\\n60,845 \\n10,000 \\n72,425  $\\n\\n917 \\n323 \\n— \\n1,240 \\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and collections results in trade receivables, unbilled receivables and contract liabilities on our Consolidated\\nBalance Sheet. Trade receivables represent actual billings that are generally due within 30 days from the invoice date, and do not bear interest. Unbilled\\nreceivables  represent  the  excess  of  revenues  recognized  over  billings  to  date  on  certain  contracts.  Receivables  are  carried  at  amounts  billed,  less  any\\nreserves  for  credit  losses,  if  any.  The  Company  periodically  assesses  collectability  of  accounts  receivable  and  records  an  expected  credit  loss  for  the\\nestimated uncollectible amount when deemed appropriate. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, allowance for doubtful accounts was insignificant.\\n\\nAdvances are given to suppliers based on the contract terms of respective agreements and are presented on a separate line on the consolidated balance\\n\\nsheets. These advances are recovered through the receipt of goods and services mainly used in the production of battery-based energy storage products.\\n\\nLeases\\n\\nThe  Company  leases  offices,  land,  warehouses,  and  equipment.  Leases  are  categorized  at  their  commencement  date  and  lease-related  assets  and\\nliabilities are recognized for all leases with an initial term of 12 months or greater. The Company evaluates renewal options at commencement and on an\\nongoing basis and includes options that are reasonably certain to exercise in its expected lease terms when classifying leases and measuring lease liabilities.\\nThe Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of the lease payments over the lease term for leases, as these leases\\ntypically do not have a stated borrowing rate. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive\\ncovenants.\\n\\nEffective October 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (\"ASC 842\"), including the subsequent ASU\\'s that amended and clarified the\\nrelated guidance. Prior to the adoption of ASC 842, the Company accounted for leases under ASC 840 and recognized rent expense on a straight-line basis\\nover the course of the lease term, which included any reasonably assured renewal periods, beginning on the date the Company took physical possession of\\nthe property. The Company adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective approach, and accordingly the new guidance was applied to leases that existed\\nor were entered into after October 1, 2021 without adjusting the comparative periods presented. Please refer to Note 8 - Leases for a discussion of our\\nupdated policies and disclosures related to leases.\\n\\nForeign Currency Transactions\\n\\nAn entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates and is generally the currency in\\nwhich the entity generates and expends cash. The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. For all Fluence subsidiary entities whose functional\\ncurrency is not in U.S. Dollar, the balance sheet and income statement are translated into US Dollar using the ending balance sheet rate and weighted\\naverage rate, respectively. Translation adjustments are included as a separate component on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss),\\nand in “Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents” on the consolidated statement of cash flows.\\n\\nBusiness Combinations\\n\\n80\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##A business combination is an acquisition of a business from an entity not under common control and is accounted for using the acquisition method.\\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value\\nof the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other net assets\\nacquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Fair value measurements may require us to make significant estimates and\\nassumptions. A measurement period, which could be up to one year from the date of the acquisition, exists to identify and measure the assets acquired and\\nliabilities  assumed.  During  the  measurement  period,  provisional  amounts  may  be  recognized,  and  those  amounts  may  subsequently  be  prospectively\\nadjusted  to  reflect  any  new  information  about  facts  and  circumstances  that  existed  at  the  acquisition  date  that,  if  known,  would  have  affected  the\\nmeasurement of these amounts. At the end of the measurement period, any subsequent changes would not be recognized under the acquisition method but\\nwould instead follow other accounting principles, which would generally impact earnings.\\n\\nRevenue and Cost Recognition\\n\\nThe Company’s revenue recognition policy included herein is based on the application of ASC 606. As of September 30, 2022, the Company’s revenue\\n\\nwas generated primarily from sale of energy storage products, providing operational services, and digital applications and solutions.\\n\\nRevenue  from  Sale  of  Energy  Storage  Products:  The  Company  enters  into  contracts  with  utility  companies,  developers,  and  commercial  and\\nindustrial customers to design and build battery-based energy storage products. Each storage product is customized depending on the customer’s energy\\nneeds. Customer payments are due upon meeting certain milestones that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. The Company determines\\nthe transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received which includes estimates of liquidated damages or other variable consideration that\\nare included in the transaction price in accordance with ASC 606. We assess any variable consideration using an expected value method. The transaction\\nprice identified is allocated to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service based on the relative standalone selling prices. Generally,\\nthe Company’s contracts to design and build battery-based storage products are determined to have one performance obligation. The Company believes that\\nthe prices negotiated with each individual customer are representative of the stand-alone selling price of the product.\\n\\nThe Company recognizes revenue over time as a result of the continuous transfer of control of our product to the customer. This continuous transfer of\\ncontrol to the customer is supported by clauses in the contracts that provide enforceable rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work\\nperformed to date for products that do not have an alternative use to the Company and/or the project is built on customer’s land that is under the customer’s\\ncontrol.\\n\\nRevenue for these performance obligations is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total\\nestimated contract costs. Standard inventory materials that could be used interchangeably on other projects are included in our measure of progress when\\nthey  are  integrated  into,  or  restricted  to,  the  production  of  the  customer’s  project.  Contract  costs  include  all  direct  material  and  labor  costs  related  to\\ncontract performance. Pre-contract costs with no future benefit are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Since the revenue recognition of these\\ncontracts depends on estimates, which are assessed continually during the term of the contract, recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as\\nthe  contract  progresses  to  completion.  The  cumulative  effects  of  revisions  of  estimated  total  contract  costs  and  revenues,  together  with  any  contract\\nreserves which may be deemed appropriate, are recorded in the period in which they occur. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is\\nreasonably possible that these estimates will be revised in a different period. When a loss is forecasted for a contract, the full amount of the anticipated loss\\nis recognized in the period in which it is determined that a loss will occur. Refer to Loss Contracts below for further discussion.\\n\\nOur contracts generally provide our customers the right to liquidated damages (“LDs”) against Fluence in the event specified milestones are not met on\\ntime, or equipment is not delivered according to contract specifications. LDs are accounted for as variable consideration, and the contract price is reduced\\nby the expected penalty or LD amount when recognizing revenue. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is\\nprobable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Estimating variable\\nconsideration requires certain estimates and assumptions, including whether and by how much a project will be delayed and/or will not meet performance\\ncontractual  specifications.  The  existence  and  measurement  of  liquidated  damages  may  also  be  impacted  by  our  judgements  about  the  probability  of\\nfavorable outcomes of customer disputes involving whether certain events qualify as force majeure or the reason for the events that caused project delays.\\nVariable consideration for liquidated damages is estimated using the expected value of the consideration to be received. If Fluence has a claim against the\\ncustomer for amount not specified in the contract, such claim is recognized as an increase to contract price when it is legally enforceable, which is usually\\nupon signing a respective change order or equivalent document confirming the claim acceptance by customer.\\n\\nRevenue from Services: The Company also enters into long-term service agreements with customers to provide operational services related to battery-\\nbased energy storage products. The services include maintenance, monitoring, and other minor services. The Company accounts for the services as a single\\nperformance obligation as the services are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customers. We recognize revenue overtime\\nusing a straight-line recognition method for these types of\\n\\n81\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##services. The Company believes using a time-based method to measure progress is appropriate as the performance obligations are satisfied evenly over\\ntime based on the fact that customers receive the services evenly. Revenue is recognized by dividing the total transaction price over the service period.\\n\\nSome  of  the  agreements  also  provide  a  commitment  to  perform  augmentation  activities  which  would  typically  be  represented  by  installation  of\\nadditional batteries, and other components as needed, to compensate for partially lost capacity due to degradation of batteries over time. The obligation to\\nperform augmentation activities can take the form of either maintaining battery capacity above a given threshold for a stated term while others provide a\\nfixed  number  of  augmentations  over  a  contract  term.  Augmentation  arrangements  that  require  us  to  maintain  battery  capacity  above  an  established\\nthresholds  for  a  given  term  are  considered  service-type  warranties.  These  represent  a  stand-ready  obligation  in  which  the  customer  benefits  evenly\\novertime, of which we recognize revenue for these arrangements using a straight-line recognition method. Alternatively, augmentation arrangements that\\nrequire us to perform a fixed number of augmentations over a contract term follow the percentage of completion revenue recognition method. Since these\\narrangements require a fixed number of augmentations we must perform, we use the pattern of cost as a proxy to identify when our obligations are satisfied\\nand to recognize revenue.\\n\\nRevenue  from  Digital  Applications  and  Solutions:  In  October  2020,  Fluence  Energy,  LLC  acquired  the  Advanced  Microgrid  Solutions  (“AMS”)\\nsoftware and digital intelligence platform, which became the Fluence Trading Platform. In April 2022, the Company acquired Nispera AG, a Zurich based\\nprovider  of  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  machine  learning-enabled  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS)  targeting  the  renewable  energy  sector.  Contracts\\ninvolving  the  Fluence  Trading  Platform  are  generally  entered  into  with  commercial  entities  that  control  utility-scale  storage  and  renewable  generation\\nassets.  Fluence  Trading  Platform  arrangements  consist  of  a  promise  to  provide  access  to  proprietary  cloud-based  Software-as-a-Service  to  promote\\nenhanced financial returns on the utility-scale storage and renewable generation assets. The Fluence Trading Platform is a hosted service that delivers\\nautomated, market-compliant bids to local electricity market operators. Customers do not receive legal title or ownership of the software as a result of these\\narrangements.\\n\\nThe Fluence Trading Platform is technology- and vendor-agnostic (i.e., it can be utilized for wind and solar assets as well as non-Fluence systems).\\nThe Fluence Trading Platform is separately identifiable from other promises that the Company offers to its customers (i.e., it is not highly interrelated or\\nintegrated with other solutions). As such, we determined that the Fluence Trading Platform is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Revenue\\nfrom the Fluence Trading Platform includes an integration fee and a monthly subscription fee. We consider the access to the Fluence Trading Platform and\\nrelated  support  services  in  a  customer  contract  to  be  a  series  of  distinct  services  which  comprise  a  single  performance  obligation  because  they  are\\nsubstantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. We recognize revenue over time using a straight-line recognition method.\\n\\nFor our sale of energy storage products, services, and digital applications and solutions contracts where there are multiple performance obligations in a\\nsingle contract, the Company allocates the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method.\\nStandalone  selling  prices  are  estimated  based  on  estimated  costs  plus  margin.  Revenue  is  recorded  net  of  any  taxes  assessed  on  and  collected  from\\ncustomers, which are remitted to the governmental authorities.\\n\\nCost of Goods and Services: Cost of goods and services consists primarily of product costs, including purchased materials and supplies, as well as\\ncosts related to shipping, customer support, product warranty and personnel. Personnel costs in cost of goods and services includes both direct labor costs\\nas well as costs attributable to any individuals whose activities relate to the transformation of raw materials or component parts into finished goods or the\\ntransportation of materials to the customer. Cost of goods and services are recognized when services are performed, or control of goods are transferred to\\nthe  customers,  which  is  generally  based  upon  International  Commercial  Terms  (commonly  referred  to  as  ‘‘incoterms’’)  stated  in  corresponding  supply\\nagreements or purchase orders. Standard inventory materials that could be used interchangeably on other projects are included in cost of goods sold when\\nthey are integrated into, or restricted to, the production of the customer’s project.\\n\\nDeferred Revenue: Deferred revenue represents the excess billings to date over the amount of revenue recognized to date. Contract advances represent\\namounts received by the Company upon signing of the related contracts with customers. The advances are offset proportionately against progress billings.\\nAny outstanding portion is included in deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\nLoss Contracts: A contract becomes a loss contract when its estimated total costs are expected to exceed its total revenue. The Company accrues the\\nfull loss expected in the period a loss contract is identified which is recorded in “Current liabilities — Accruals and provisions” and “Cost of goods and\\nservices” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, respectively.\\n\\nInventory, Net\\n\\nInventory consists of batteries and equipment, cases, inverters, and spare parts which are used in ongoing battery storage projects for sale. Inventory is\\nstated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined by the specific identification method. Costs include cost of purchase, costs of\\nconversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present\\n\\n82\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##location and condition. The Company periodically reviews its inventory for potential obsolescence and write down of its inventory, as appropriate, to net\\nrealizable value based on its assessment of market conditions.\\n\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\\n\\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of its property and equipment, and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\\nthat their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The assets are considered impaired when their future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying\\nvalue and fair value is less than their carrying value. Impairment charges are calculated as the difference between the discounted expected future cash\\nflows, or other accepted valuation techniques to determine fair value and the assets’ carrying amount at the date of the triggering event.\\n\\nIntangible Assets\\n\\nIntangible assets are stated at their historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. Intangible assets are reviewed\\n\\nfor impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\\n\\nSupply Chain Financing\\n\\nWe  have  provided  certain  of  our  suppliers  with  access  to  a  supply  chain  financing  program  through  a  third-party  financing  institution  (the  “SCF\\nBank”). This program allows us to seek extended payment terms with our suppliers, and allows our suppliers to monetize their receivables prior to the\\npayment due date, subject to a discount. Once a supplier elects to participate in the program and reaches an agreement with the SCF Bank, the supplier\\nelects which individual invoices to sell to the SCF Bank. We then pay the SCF Bank on the invoice due date. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s\\ndecision to sell a receivable to the SCF Bank. The agreements between our suppliers and the SCF Bank are solely at their discretion and are negotiated\\ndirectly between them. Our suppliers’ ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of our financial condition and\\nguarantees issued by AES and Siemens. As of September 30, 2022, AES and Siemens issued guarantees of $50 million each, for a total of $100 million, to\\nthe SCF Bank on our behalf.\\n\\nAs of September 30, 2022, three suppliers were actively participating in the supply chain financing program, and we had $37.4 million of payables\\noutstanding  subject  to  the  program.  All  outstanding  payments  owed  under  the  program  are  recorded  within  “Accounts  payable”  in  our  Consolidated\\nBalance Sheets.\\n\\nAccruals and Provisions\\n\\nExpenses are recognized on an accrual basis. Provisions are recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of liability\\n\\ncould be reasonably estimated.\\n\\nOperating Expenses\\n\\nOperating expenses include research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization.\\nResearch  and  development  expenses  represent  personnel  costs  of  the  technology  team,  and  costs  of  materials  and  services  procured  for  research  and\\ndevelopment projects. Sales and marketing expenses represent personnel costs of the sales team and all marketing expenses. General and administrative\\nexpenses represent personnel costs, rent, IT expenses insurance, and external providers for payroll, accounting, consulting, and others. Depreciation and\\namortization are expenses associated with property and equipment and intangible assets.\\n\\nAdvertising Costs\\n\\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1.4 million, $0.8 million, and $0.7 million for the years ended September 30,\\n\\n2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\\n\\n(Loss) per Share\\n\\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company has three classes of common stock, Class A, Class B-1 and Class B-2. Loss per share is calculated and\\nreported under the “two-class” method. The “two-class” method is an earnings allocation method under which earnings (loss) per share is calculated for\\neach class of common stock considering both distributions declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such loss had\\nbeen distributed during the period.\\n\\nBasic net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Class A common stockholders by the weighted\\naverage number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by\\nadjusting the net loss available to Class A common stockholders and the weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding to give effect to\\npotentially dilutive securities. Shares of our Class B-1 and Class B-2 common\\n\\n83\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##stock are not entitled to receive any distributions or dividends. When a common unit of Fluence Energy, LLC is redeemed, at the Company’s election, for\\ncash or Class A common stock by a Founder who holds shares of our Class B-1 or Class B-2 common stock, such Founder will be required to surrender a\\nshare  of  Class  B-1  or  Class  B-2  common  stock,  as  the  case  may  be,  which  we  will  cancel  for  no  consideration.  In  the  event  of  cash  settlement,  the\\nCompany is required to issue new shares of Class A common stock and use the proceeds from the sale of these newly-issued shares of Class A common\\nstock to fully fund the cash settlement. Therefore, we did not include shares of our Class B-1 or Class B-2 common stock in the computation of basic loss\\nper share. As we have incurred losses for all periods presented, diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share because the effect of potentially\\ndilutive securities would be antidilutive.\\n\\nThe potentially dilutive securities that were excluded consist of 58,586,695 shares of Class B-1 common stock, 8,923,121 outstanding stock options,\\n\\n605,591 outstanding phantom units, and 2,156,893 outstanding restricted stock units as of September 30, 2022.\\n\\nIn October 2021, the existing limited liability company agreement of Fluence Energy, LLC was amended and restated which recapitalized all existing\\ninterests  in  the  Company  on  the  basis  of  a  14.79-for-1  split.  All  shares  and  per  share  information  has  been  retroactively  adjusted  to  give  effect  to  the\\nrecapitalization for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated.\\n\\nAll earnings or loss prior to and up to November 1, 2021, the date of completion of the IPO, were entirely allocable to non-controlling interest and, as a\\nresult, loss per share information is not applicable for reporting periods prior to this date. Consequently, only the net loss allocable to Fluence Energy, Inc.\\nfrom the period subsequent to November 1, 2021 is included in the net loss attributable to the stockholders of Class A common stock for the twelve months\\nended September 30, 2022. Basic and diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2022,\\nrespectively, have been computed as follows:\\n\\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\\nNumerator:\\nNet loss\\nLess: Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests\\nNet loss attributable to Fluence Energy, Inc.\\n\\nDenominator:\\nWeighted average shares of Class A common stock - basic and diluted\\nLoss per share of Class A common stock - basic and diluted\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nTwelve Months Ended\\nSeptember 30, 2022\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n(289,177)\\n(184,692)\\n(104,485)\\n\\n69,714,054 \\n(1.50)\\n\\nFluence Energy, LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, the members are individually liable for their own\\ndistributable share of taxable income or loss. After our IPO, we are now subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes with respect to our allocable share of\\nany taxable income or loss of Fluence Energy, LLC, and we will be taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates.\\n\\nWe will continue to be subject to foreign income taxes with respect to our foreign subsidiaries and our expectations are valuation allowances will be\\nneeded in certain tax jurisdictions. Foreign subsidiaries of the Company account for income taxes and the related accounts in accordance with ASC 740,\\nIncome Taxes. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of\\nassets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.\\n\\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by\\n\\nthe taxing authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\n\\nThe  preparation  of  income  tax  returns  requires  the  use  of  management’s  estimates  and  interpretations  which  may  be  subjected  to  review  by  the\\n\\nrespective taxing authorities and may result in an assessment of additional taxes, penalties, and interest.\\n\\nFair Value Measurements\\n\\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in\\nconnection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\\nmeasurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and\\n\\n84\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The following fair value hierarchy,\\ndefined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used to\\nvalue the assets and liabilities:\\n\\nLevel 1—Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which\\n\\ntransactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\\n\\nLevel 2—Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the\\nreporting  date.  Level  2  inputs  include  those  financial  instruments  that  are  valued  using  models  or  other  valuation  methodologies.  These  models  are\\nprimarily  industry-standard  models  that  consider  various  assumptions,  including  quoted  prices,  time  value,  volatility  factors,  and  current  market  and\\ncontractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the\\nmarketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are\\nexecuted in the marketplace.\\n\\nLevel 3—Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally\\ndeveloped methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The Company does not have\\nany recurring Level 3 fair value measurements.\\n\\nThe Company’s cash equivalents include term deposits with original maturity of less than three months and are recorded at amortized cost. Fair value\\nof  cash  equivalents  approximates  the  carrying  amount.  The  carrying  amounts  of  trade  receivables,  accounts  payable  and  short-term  debt  obligations\\napproximate fair values due to their short maturities.\\n\\nShort-term  Investments  and  Marketable  Securities:  We  obtain  pricing  from  level  1  inputs  which  includes  information  from  quoted  market  prices,\\npricing vendors or quotes from brokers/dealers. We conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendors to determine whether the inputs used in the vendor’s\\npricing processes are deemed to be observable. The fair value of U.S. Treasury securities and government-related securities, corporate bonds and notes and\\ncommon stock is generally determined using standard observable inputs, including reported trades, quoted market prices, matrix pricing, benchmark yields,\\nbroker/dealer  quotes,  issuer  spreads,  two-sided  markets  and/or  benchmark  securities.  The  Company  recorded  a  gain  of  $0.2  million  from  short-term\\ninvestments for the year ending September 30, 2022.\\n\\nin thousands\\nBeginning balance\\nContributions / (withdrawals)\\nChanges in fair market value\\nEnding Balance\\n\\nReclassification\\n\\nTwelve Months Ended\\n \\nSeptember 30, 2022\\n— \\n110,143 \\n212 \\n110,355 \\n\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n\\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation on the consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash\\nflow.

This standard requires all leases to be\\nrecognized on the consolidated balance sheet. The FASB\\nhas issued several amendments to ASU 2016-02, including\\nASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements\\nthat introduced an additional transition method permitting\\nan entity to initially apply the new lease standard at the\\nadoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment\\nto the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of\\nadoption. ASU 2016-02 includes optional practical\\nexpedients intended to reduce the cost and complexity to\\nimplement the new lease standard, such as an option to\\nmaintain the current lease classification for all existing\\nlease arrangements and the option to use hindsight in\\nevaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease. In\\nJune 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-05 delaying the\\neffective date for nonpublic entities that had not already\\nadopted the New Standard. Following this additional\\nguidance, the New Standard is effective for annual periods\\nin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and\\ninterim periods in fiscal years beginning after December\\n15, 2022.\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which\\nupdates the impairment model for financial assets\\nmeasured at amortized cost, known as the Current\\nExpected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. For trade and other\\nreceivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and\\nother instruments, entities will be required to use a new\\nforward-looking “expected loss” model that generally will\\nresult in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses.\\nThere are various transition methods available upon\\nadoption. Early adoption is permitted.\\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, which\\nremoves certain exceptions related to the approach for\\nintraperiod tax allocations, the methodology for calculating\\nincome taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of\\ndeferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The\\nguidance also clarifies and simplifies other areas of ASC\\n740. Certain amendments must be applied on a prospective\\nbasis, certain amendments must be applied on a\\nretrospective basis, and certain amendments must be\\napplied on a modified retrospective basis through a\\ncumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit)\\nin the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted.\\nThe amendments in this ASU clarify the interaction\\nbetween the accounting for investments in equity\\nsecurities, investment in equity method and certain\\nderivatives instruments. The ASU is expected to reduce\\ndiversity in practice and increase comparability of the\\naccounting for these interactions.\\n\\nASU 2020-01, Investments—\\nEquity Securities (Topic 321),\\nInvestments—Equity Method and\\nJoint Ventures (Topic 323), and\\nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic\\n815)\\n \\n\\nASU 2019-12, Income Taxes\\n(Topic 740): Simplifying the\\nAccounting for Income Taxes\\n\\n86\\n\\nDate of adoption\\nOctober 1, 2021\\n\\nEffect on the financial\\nstatements and other significant\\nmatters\\nThe Company adopted the new\\nleases standard utilizing the\\nmodified retrospective transition\\nmethod, under which amounts in\\nprior periods presented were not\\nrestated.

Leases\\n\\n10 years\\n5 years\\n5 years\\n10 years, or lease term if shorter\\n2 years\\n\\nOn October 1, 2021 the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (\"ASC 842\") including the subsequent ASU\\'s that amended and clarified the related\\nguidance. ASC 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract\\ninception. A lease exists when a contract conveys to the customer the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for\\nconsideration. The definition of a lease embodies two conditions: (1) there is an identified asset in the contract, and (2) the customer has the right to control\\nthe  use  of  the  identified  asset.  Lessees  are  required  to  classify  leases  as  either  finance  or  operating  leases.  This  classification  will  determine\\nwhether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\\n\\nASC 842 provided several optional practical expedients for use in transition to and ongoing application of ASC 842. The Company elected to utilize\\nthe package of practical expedients in ASC 842-10-65-1(f) that, upon adoption of ASC 842, allows entities to (1) not reassess whether any expired or\\nexisting contracts are or contain leases, (2) retain the classification of leases (e.g., operating or finance lease) existing as of the date of adoption and (3) not\\nreassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company did not elect the practical expedient pertaining to the use of hindsight. For all asset classes\\nwhich the Company currently has leases, the Company elected to utilize the practical expedient in ASC 842-10-15-37 in which the Company has chosen to\\naccount for each separate lease component of a contract and its associated non-lease components as a single lease component.\\n\\nThe  Company’s  right-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities  primarily  relate  to  offices,  land,  warehouses,  and  equipment.  The  Company’s  leases  have\\nremaining lease terms of one year to three years . The Company\\'s leases are all classified as operating leases. Certain of the Company’s leases contain\\nrenewal, extension, or termination options. The Company assesses each option on an individual basis and will only include options reasonably certain of\\nexercise  in  the  lease  term.  The  Company  generally  considers  the  base  term  to  be  the  term  provided  in  the  contract.  None  of  the\\nCompany’s  lease  agreements  contain  material  options  to  purchase  the  leased  property,  material  residual  value  guarantees,  or  material  restrictions  or\\ncovenants.\\n\\nThe Company does not recognize a lease liability or right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for short-term leases. Instead, the Company recognizes\\nshort-term lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. A short-term lease is defined as a lease that, at the commencement\\ndate, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.\\nLeases (with terms greater than twelve months) are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet\\npaid. As the Company\\'s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of\\ninterest  for  collateralized  borrowing  over  a  similar  term  of  the  lease  payments  at  commencement  date  to  calculate  the  present  value  of\\nfuture  lease  payments.  Certain  leases  include  payments  that  are  based  solely  on  an  index  or  rate.  These  variable  lease  payments  are  included  in  the\\ncalculation  of  the  ROU  asset  and  lease  liability  and  are  initially  measured  using  the  index  or  rate  at  the  lease  commencement  date.  Other\\nvariable  lease  payments,  such  as  payments  based  on  use  and  for  property  taxes,  insurance,  or  common  area  maintenance  that  are  based  on  actual\\nassessments are excluded from the ROU asset and lease liability and are expensed as incurred. In addition to the present value of the future lease payments,\\nthe  calculation  of  the  ROU  asset  also  includes  adjustments  for  lease  incentives,  deferred  rent,  lease  prepayments  and  initial  direct  costs  of  obtaining\\nthe lease, such as commissions.\\n\\nCertain lease contracts contain nonlease components such as maintenance and utilities. As discussed above, the Company has made an accounting\\npolicy  election,  as  allowed  under  ASC  842-10-15-37,  to  capitalize  both  the  lease  component  and  nonlease  components  of  its  contracts  as  a\\nsingle lease component for its right-of-use assets. This election applies at the asset class level.\\n\\nThe Company has subleased a portion of an office to third party where the Company remains primarily liable to the landlord for the performance of all\\n\\nobligations in the event that the sub-lessee does not perform its obligations under the lease. As a result of the\\n\\n92\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##sublease arrangements, future rental commitments under the operating lease will be offset by sublease amounts to be paid by the sub-lessee. In general, the\\nterms of the sublease are similar to the terms of the master lease.\\n\\nin thousands\\nLease cost\\nOperating lease cost\\nVariable lease cost\\nSublease income\\nTotal lease cost\\n\\nSupplemental information related to the Company\\'s leases for the year ended September 30, 2022 was as follows:\\n\\nin thousands\\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurements of lease liabilities\\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities\\nWeighted average remaining lease term - operating leases\\nWeighted average discount rate - operating leases\\n\\nYear Ended\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2022\\n\\n1,713\\n765\\n(182)\\n2,296\\n\\nYear Ended\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2022\\n\\n1,880\\n918\\n1.4 years\\n3.17 %\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n$\\n\\nTotal remaining lease payments under the Company\\'s leases for each of the succeeding years is as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nYear Ended September 30,\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n2026\\n2027\\nThereafter\\nTotal lease payments\\nLess: Interest\\nPresent value of lease liabilities\\n\\n9.\\n\\nIntangible Assets, Net\\n\\nIntangible assets are stated at amortized cost and consist of the following:\\n\\nOperating Leases\\n\\n1,797\\n724\\n274\\n38\\n–\\n–\\n2,833\\n(90)\\n2,743\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nin thousands\\nPatents and licenses\\nDeveloped technology \\n(a)\\nCustomer relationship \\nTradenames/Trademarks \\nOther\\nTotal\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nWeighted Average\\n\\nEstimated Useful Lives\\n\\n14 years $\\n12 years\\n6 years\\n11 years\\n6 years\\n\\n$\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2022\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2021\\n\\nCost\\n28,551  $\\n28,347 \\n3,340 \\n5,216 \\n1,213 \\n66,667  $\\n\\nAccumulated\\nAmortization\\n\\n(9,033) $\\n(2,720)\\n(263)\\n(2,679)\\n(276)\\n\\n(14,971) $\\n\\nNet\\n19,518  $\\n25,627  $\\n3,077 \\n2,537 \\n937 \\n\\n51,696  $\\n\\nCost\\n32,982  $\\n12,600  $\\n\\n— \\n— \\n894 \\n\\nAccumulated\\nAmortization\\n\\n(9,207) $\\n(1,050) $\\n\\n— \\n— \\n(162)\\n\\n46,476  $\\n\\n(10,419) $\\n\\nNet\\n23,775 \\n11,550 \\n— \\n— \\n732 \\n36,057 \\n\\n(a) The intangible assets as of September 30, 2022 included $16.5 million, $3.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, related to the acquisition of Nispera discussed in Note 4 - Business\\nCombinations.\\n\\n93\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets on a straight-line basis.

Fluence Energy, LLC is\\nrequired to pay to the lenders a commitment fee of 0.55% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving commitments through maturity.\\nThe Revolver also provides for up to $200.0 million in letter of credit issuances, which will require customary issuance and administration fees, as well as a\\nfronting fee payable to each issuer thereof and a letter of credit participation fee of 2.75% per annum payable to the lenders.\\n\\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary covenants for these types of financing, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict our ability to\\nincur additional indebtedness; incur liens; sell, transfer, or dispose of property and assets; make investments or acquisitions; make dividends, distributions\\nor other restricted payments; and engage in affiliate transactions. The Credit Agreement limits our ability to make certain payments, including dividends\\nand distributions on Fluence Energy, LLC’s equity, Fluence Energy, Inc.’s equity and other restricted payments. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit\\nAgreement, Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries are currently limited in their ability to pay cash dividends to, lend to, or make other investments in\\nFluence Energy, Inc., subject to certain exceptions, including among others (i) the ability to make investments of up to the greater of (a) $10,500,000 and\\n(b) 1.5% of the consolidated assets of Fluence Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and (ii) the ability to issue dividends and make other Restricted Payments\\n(as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) (a) if after giving pro forma effect to such dividend or other Restricted Payment the Total Liquidity (as\\ndefined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) of Fluence Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries party to the Revolving Credit Agreement is at least $600,000,000,\\nand (b) such dividend or other Restricted Payment is made to reimburse Fluence Energy, Inc. for certain tax distributions under the Fluence Energy LLC\\nAgreement and certain payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and certain operational expenses incurred in connection with the ownership and\\nmanagement of Fluence Energy, LLC.

The Company determined that based on the weight of\\navailable  evidence,  including  cumulative  losses,  it  is  more-likely-than-not  that  the  net  deferred  tax  assets  at  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  and  its  German  and\\nAustralian entities will not be realized and recorded a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets.\\n\\nThe net increase in the valuation allowance of $342.8 million in fiscal year 2022 is due to a $302.5 million increase recorded through equity related to\\nthe  IPO  and  other  organizational  transactions,  a  $43.6  million  increase  in  valuation  allowance  related  to  current  year  activity  in  jurisdictions  with  full\\nvaluation allowances, and a $3.2 million decrease related to currency translation adjustments. Further, a future reversal of $3.0 million of the valuation\\nallowance on deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2022, would be accounted for as an increase in equity.\\n\\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company has not recognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. During the year, the German tax\\nauthorities audited Fluence Germany for the period beginning January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2021. In October of 2022, the tax authorities issued a\\nreport confirming no finding upon the finalization of the audit. With the exception of Germany, the period from January 1, 2018 until September 30, 2022\\nremains subject to examination by foreign, federal and state\\n\\n97\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##taxing authorities. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\n\\nOn  August  16,  2022,  the  US  enacted  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act  of  2022,  which,  among  other  things,  implements  a  15%  minimum  tax  on  book\\nincome of certain large corporations effective in 2024, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022 and several tax incentives to\\npromote clean energy. We are still evaluating the impact these Inflation Reduction Act related tax incentives may have on our financial results as we go\\nforward.\\n\\n14. Commitments and Contingencies\\n\\nGuarantees\\n\\nAs  of  September  30,  2022,  the  Company  had  outstanding  bank  guarantees  issued  as  performance  security  arrangements  for  several  projects.\\n\\nPerformance security is a precondition to receive any payment from the customer and is reduced in stages according to the project completion status.\\n\\nTypical turn-key contracts and long-term service agreements contain provisions for performance liquidated damages payments if the solution fails to\\n\\nmeet the guaranteed performance thresholds at completion of the project or throughout the service agreement period.\\n\\nPurchase Commitments\\n\\nThe Company has commitments for minimum volumes of purchases of batteries under a master supply agreement. Liquidated damages apply if the\\nminimum purchase volumes are not met. The Company expects to meet the minimum committed volumes of purchases. The following presents our future\\nminimum  purchase  commitments  by  fiscal  year,  primarily  for  batteries,  and  liquidated  damages  if  the  minimum  purchase  volumes  are  not  met  as  of\\nSeptember 30, 2022:\\n\\nin thousands\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n2026 and thereafter\\nTotal\\n\\nPurchase Commitments\\n\\nLiquidated Damages\\n\\n665,871  $\\n768,898 \\n170,295 \\n4,050 \\n\\n1,609,114  $\\n\\n30,799 \\n122,157 \\n33,321 \\n2,502 \\n188,779 \\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\nWe are currently renegotiating our existing master service agreement with one of our largest battery suppliers, and the purchase commitments set forth\\nabove are not reflective of any increase in price that results from such negotiation.\\n\\nDuring the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, the Company made a $60.0 million advance payment as a capacity guarantee pursuant to a purchase\\nagreement with one of our suppliers, of which, as of September 30, 2022, the balances of $51.3 million and $8.8 million are recorded within “Current\\nassets - Advances to suppliers” and “Non-current assets - Advances to suppliers”, respectively, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\nWarranties\\n\\nThe Company is party to both assurance and service-type warranties for various lengths of time. The Company recognizes revenue for service type\\nwarranties using either a straight-line or cost to cost method depending on the contract. Extended warranties that customers purchase separately from the\\nrelated products and services are accounted for as separate performance obligations.\\n\\nThe Company provides a limited warranty related to the successful operation of battery-based energy storage solutions, apart from the service type\\n\\nwarranties described above and are normally provided for a limited period of time from one to five years, after the commercial operation date or substantial\\ncompletion depending on the contract terms. The warranties are considered assurance-type warranties which provide a guarantee of quality of the products.\\n\\nFor assurance-type warranties, the Company records an estimate of future warranty cost when the battery energy solution is transferred to the customer\\nand the future costs of servicing the warranty are both probable and estimable. Periodically, the Company evaluates and adjusts warranty costs to the extent\\nthat actual warranty costs materially differ from the original estimates. As of September 30, 2022, the Company accrued warranty liabilities of $1.6 million.\\nNo liability was recorded as of September 30, 2021 as no material amount of costs for assurance type warranties were deemed probable and estimable.\\n\\nThe warranty liability was recorded as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n98\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Beginning balance, warranty liability\\nIncrease (decrease) to ST warranty accrual estimate\\nIncrease (decrease) to LT warranty accrual estimate\\nEnding balance, aggregate warranty liability\\n\\nLegal Contingencies\\n\\nFiscal year ended September 30,\\n2022\\n2021\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n—  $\\n\\n786.3 \\n838.7 \\n\\n1,625.0  $\\n\\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n\\nFrom time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims that arise out of our operations and businesses and that cover a wide\\nrange of matters, including, among others, intellectual property matters, contract and employment claims, personal injury claims, product liability claims\\nand warranty claims. The Company accrues for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be\\nreasonably estimated. It is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to pay\\ndamages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material.\\n\\nThe following discusses certain potential loss contingencies as of September 30, 2022:\\n\\n2021 Cargo Loss Incident\\n\\nOn April 28, 2021, the Company was notified of an emergency aboard a vessel carrying Fluence inventory. This incident resulted in damage to a\\nportion of our cargo aboard the vessel. The Company recorded $13.0 million provision to its inventory as of September 30, 2021 based on the net realizable\\nvalue of cargo that was destroyed. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, $13.0 million of inventory was written off. In addition to the\\ninventory losses, we have incurred and expect to incur incremental expenses related to the incident, primarily consisting of inspection costs, project cost\\noverruns due to logistical changes, legal fees, fees to dispose of the damaged cargo, and additional cost to replace the damaged cargo. We received an\\naggregate of $10.0 million insurance proceeds related to non-disputed claims, $7.5 million of which was collected in October 2021 and the remaining\\n$2.5 million was collected in April 2022.\\n\\n2021 Overheating Event at Customer Facility\\n\\nOn September 4, 2021, a 300 MW energy storage facility owned by one of our customers experienced an overheating event. Fluence served as the\\nenergy storage technology provider designed and installed portions of the facility, which was completed in fiscal year 2021. No injuries were reported from\\nthe  incident.  The  facility  was  taken  offline  as  teams  from  Fluence,  our  customer,  and  the  battery  designer/manufacturer  investigated  the  incident.  Our\\ncustomer released initial findings in the second fiscal quarter of 2022 on what it contends is the root cause of the incident. At this time, Fluence cannot\\ncomment on or accept the customer’s stated findings. The customer’s stated findings, if ultimately confirmed and proven, could relate to certain scopes of\\nwork for which Fluence or its subcontractors could be responsible. The customer’s stated findings, however, could also relate to certain scopes of work for\\nwhich other parties were responsible and/or relate to other causes, including the design and installation of portions of the facility over which Fluence did\\nnot  have  responsibility  or  control.  The  customer  has  alleged  that  Fluence  is  liable  for  the  incident  but  has  not  yet  demanded  a  specific  amount  of\\ncompensation nor alleged a particular level of responsibility. Fluence has denied liability. No formal legal proceedings have been commenced, but it is\\nreasonably possible that litigation may result from this matter if a resolution cannot be achieved. Any such dispute would also likely include claims by\\nFluence  and  counterclaims  by  the  customer  relating  to  disputed  costs  arising  from  the  original  design  and  construction  of  the  facility.  The  customer\\nannounced in July of 2022 that a large portion of the facility was back online. We are currently not able to estimate the impact, that this incident may have\\non our financial results. To date, we do not believe that this incident has impacted the market’s adoption of our products.\\n\\n2022 Overheating Event at Customer Facility\\n\\nOn April 18, 2022, a 10 MW energy storage facility in Chandler, Arizona owned by AES experienced an overheating event. Fluence served as the\\nenergy storage technology provider for the facility, which was completed in 2019, and Fluence currently provides maintenance services for the facility.\\nThere were no injuries. The facility has been taken offline as teams from Fluence, AES, and the battery manufacturer investigate the incident. We are\\ncurrently not able to estimate the impact, if any, that this incident may have on our reputation or financial results, or on market adoption of our products.\\n\\n99\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Negotiations with our Largest Battery Module Vendor\\n\\nIn  December  2021  we  entered  into  negotiations  with  our  largest  battery  module  vendor  to  amend  our  battery  supply  agreement.  As part of these\\ndiscussions the vendor is seeking to renegotiate the price we were to pay the vendor for battery modules purchased in calendar 2022 as well as those\\nexpected to be purchased during the remainder of 2022 as well as 2023 calendar years. As part of these negotiations, we also discussed settlement of\\ndamages incurred by Fluence for defective products and delays caused by the battery module vendor. These negotiations continued throughout fiscal year\\n2022 with no agreement on pricing or key terms. In December 2022, we reached an agreement in principle, on pricing related to calendar year 2022 and\\n2023. As a result, our costs related to batteries purchased in calendar year 2022 increased by $66.1 million, of which $17.9 million has been recognized as\\ncost of goods and services, $31.8 million as an increase the value of inventory in fiscal year 2022. The remainder will be incurred in the first quarter of\\n2023. In addition, we agreed in principle to settle damages, in which the battery module vendor will remit a payment to the Company for the amount of\\n$20.0 million, for lost revenues that we incurred primarily as a result of battery module supply delays. The payment represents a gain contingency and will\\nbe recognized in our financial statements when realized. Furthermore, the battery module vendor has agreed to reimburse us for $3.1 million related to\\ncosts incurred for product defects. As the costs were incurred prior to September 30, 2022 we have recorded a receivable for the claim. As the claim for\\nliquidated damages, cost reimbursement and batteries were negotiated at the same time, we evaluated the agreement to determine each of these components\\nwere recognized (or will be recognized) based upon their relative fair value. This determination required the use of judgement and estimates in to develop\\nstandalone value. The amounts, timing and the nature of the amended battery module agreement and settlements is dependent upon us reaching a final\\nagreement which may not occur.\\n\\n15. Related-Party Transactions\\n\\nRelated parties are represented by AES and Siemens, their respective subsidiaries and other entities under common control. As of September 30, 2022,\\nAES holds  58,586,695  shares  of  Class  B-1  common  stock  of  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  and  Siemens  hold  and  aggregate  of  58,586,695  shares  of  Class  A\\ncommon stock of Fluence Energy, Inc.\\n\\nCapital Contributions from Members\\n\\nIn June 2021, Siemens made $6.3 million capital contribution in cash to the Company in exchange for certain amendments to the Company’s limited\\n\\nliability company agreement.

Employee Benefit Plan\\n\\nThe  Company  maintains  a  401(k)  plan  covering  all  eligible  U.S.  payroll  employees.  The  401(k)  plan  provides  that  eligible  employees  may  make\\ncontributions subject to IRS limitations. Under terms of the 401(k) plan, the Company matches an employee’s contributions at a rate of 100% up to 5% of\\nthe  employee’s  annual  salary.  For  the  fiscal  years  ended  September  30,  2022,  2021  and  2020,  the  Company  contributed  approximately  $4.1  million,\\n$1.9 million and $0.9 million to the 401(k) plan, respectively.\\n\\n17. Stock-Based Compensation\\n\\nThe Company expenses the grant date fair value of all awards using the straight-line method over the applicable service period. The Company has\\nmade a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. If there are any modifications of the underlying invested securities or the terms of the unit\\noption or phantom unit, it may be necessary to accelerate or increase any remaining unamortized unit-based compensation expense.\\n\\n101\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##The Option Plan\\n\\nIn 2020, the Company established the Nonqualified Unit Option Plan (“the Option Plan”) under which 8,923,121 stock options with an exercise price\\nof  $2.45  remain  outstanding  as  of  September  30,  2022.  Stock  options  under  the  plan  have  a  contractual  term  of  10  years  from  the  date  of  grant.  The\\nCompany estimates the fair value of the unit-based awards, including unit options and phantom awards, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\\nDetermining the fair value of unit-based awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the unit underlying the award,\\nthe expected term of the award and expected unit price volatility. The outstanding awards will continue to be governed by their existing terms under the\\nOption Plan.

All units\\ngranted vest upon the satisfaction of a performance condition, if the condition is met before the awards’ expiration date. The performance condition is\\nsatisfied upon the occurrence of a liquidity event, which is the earlier of either six months after the effective date of a registration statement for our IPO or a\\nchange in control.\\n\\nAs a liquidity event had not occurred as of September 30, 2021, no compensation costs were recorded during the fiscal year ended September 30,\\n2021. The completion of the IPO on November 1, 2021 resulted in achievement of the performance condition underlying awards granted under the 2020\\nPlans. Accordingly, previously unrecognized stock compensation expense was recognized during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.\\n\\nThe grant date fair value of the phantom units was $2.20 per unit. Phantom units granted to foreign employees in certain countries will require cash\\nsettlement. As such, the awards which require cash settlement are classified as liability awards. The remainder of the phantom units include a contingent\\ncash settlement option outside the control of the holder and as such are classified as equity.\\n\\nThe following table presents information concerning the outstanding phantom units granted by the Company:\\n\\nOutstanding – As of September 30, 2021\\nGranted\\nExercised\\nForfeited\\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2022\\n\\nNumber of Units\\n\\n2,169,060 \\n— \\n(1,427,662)\\n(135,807)\\n605,591 \\n\\nTotal  compensation  cost  related  to  nonvested  awards  not  yet  recognized  as  of  September  30,  2022  totaled  $8.4  million,  and  is  expected  to  be\\nrecognized over a weighted average period of 1.2 years.

CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE REGISTRANT\\n\\nFLUENCE ENERGY, INC.\\n\\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n(PARENT COMPANY ONLY)\\n\\n(U.S. Dollars in Thousands)\\n\\n1. Organization and Operations\\n\\nFluence Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company” and the “Parent Company”), was formed on June 21, 2021. We conduct our business\\noperations  through  Fluence  Energy,  LLC  and  its  direct  and  indirect  subsidiaries.  Upon  the  completion  of  our  Initial  Public  Offering  (the  “IPO”)  on\\nNovember 1, 2021, Fluence Energy, Inc. became a holding company whose sole material assets are the LLC Interests in Fluence Energy LLC. All of our\\nbusiness is conducted through Fluence Energy, LLC, together with its subsidiaries. Fluence Energy LLC is treated as a partnership for federal income tax\\npurposes and, as a result, its members, including Fluence Energy, Inc. will pay income taxes with respect to their allocable shares of its net taxable income.\\n\\nOur fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. References to “fiscal year 2020”, “fiscal year 2021” and “fiscal year 2022” refer to the\\n\\nfiscal years ended September 30, 2020, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\\n\\nOn November 1, 2021, the Parent Company completed an IPO and a series of organization transactions (collectively with the IPO, the “Transactions”),\\nin which the Company issued and sold 35,650,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Class A common stock”), at the\\npublic offering price of $28.00 per share, which includes the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 4,650,000 shares of the\\nClass  A  common  stock.  The  net  proceeds  to  the  Company  from  the  IPO  were  $948.0  million,  after  deducting  underwriting  discounts.  Other  offering\\nexpenses incurred related to the IPO were paid for by Fluence Energy, LLC.\\n\\n2. Basis of Presentation\\n\\nThese condensed parent company financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Fluence Energy Inc.\\nand  the  accompanying  notes  thereto,  included  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K.  For  purposes  of  these  condensed  financial  statements,  the  Parent\\nCompany\\'s interest in Fluence Energy LLC is recorded based upon its proportionate share of Fluence Energy LLC’s net assets (similar to presenting them\\non the equity method).\\n\\nCertain  intercompany  balances  presented  in  these  condensed  parent  company  financial  statements  are  eliminated  in  the  consolidated  financial\\n\\nstatements. $0.2 million of payables were eliminated in consolidation as of September 30, 2022.\\n\\n3. Commitments and Contingencies\\n\\nOn October 27, 2021, the Parent Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”) with Fluence Energy, LLC\\nand Siemens Industry and AES Grid Stability (the “Founders”) which obligates the Company to make payments to the Founders of 85% of the amount of\\ncertain tax benefits that Fluence Energy, Inc. actually realizes, or in some circumstances is deemed to realize, arising from the Basis Adjustments and\\ncertain other tax benefits arising from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Increases in tax basis and tax basis adjustments generated over\\ntime may increase (for tax purposes) the depreciation and amortization deductions available to Fluence Energy, Inc. and, therefore, may reduce the amount\\nof U.S. federal, state, and local tax that Fluence Energy, Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of\\nthe validity of that tax basis, and a court could sustain such a challenge.\\n\\nThe  amounts  payable  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  are  contingent  upon  (i)  sufficient  taxable  income  to  fully  utilize  the  tax  benefits;  (ii)\\nFluence Energy, LLC is able to fully depreciate or amortize its assets; and (iii) no material changes in applicable tax law. The payments under the Tax\\nReceivable Agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of us by the Founders. As of September 30, 2022, we determined it is not probable\\nthat payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would be made, given there was no expectation of future sufficient taxable income over the term of the\\nagreement to utilize deductions in the future.\\n\\nSee Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding pending and threatening litigation.\\n\\n108\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##SCHEDULE II.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\\nNone.\\n\\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\n\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\n\\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objective that information in our Exchange\\nAct reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified and pursuant to the requirements of the SEC’s rules and\\nforms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,\\nas  appropriate  to  allow  for  timely  decisions  regarding  required  disclosures.  In  designing  and  evaluating  the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,\\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving\\nthe  desired  control  objectives,  and  management  is  required  to  apply  its  judgment  in  evaluating  the  cost-benefit  relationship  of  possible  controls  and\\nprocedures.\\n\\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of\\nour disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2022, the\\nend of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, and as a result of the material weaknesses described below,\\nmanagement concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level.\\n\\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and\\n15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Under the supervision and with\\nthe participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of\\nour internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\\n\\nIn accordance with guidance issued by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude recently acquired businesses from the scope of their assessment of\\ninternal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Accordingly, we have excluded from our assessment the\\ninternal control over financial reporting of Nispera AG, which we acquired in April 2022 and which is included in our consolidated financial statements for\\nthe fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, and constituted 2% of total assets as of September 30, 2022.\\n\\nBased  on  this  evaluation,  our  management  has  concluded  the  Company  did  not  maintain  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2022 as a result of the material weakness discussed below.\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems\\n\\ndetermined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\\n\\n109\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Material Weaknesses and Remediation Measures\\n\\nA  material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a  combination  of  deficiencies,  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  such  that  there  is  a  reasonable\\n\\npossibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\\n\\nAs of September 30, 2022, a material weakness in the internal control over revenue recognition and related inventory has not been fully remediated.\\nThe Company did not sufficiently design and implement controls related to revenue recognition and associated processes, including in-transit and delivered\\nequipment and liquidated damages.\\n\\nWe  assessed  the  material  weakness  as  not  fully  remediated  due  to  the  timing  of  control  implementation  and  operating  issues  identified  in\\nmanagement’s assessment of controls. However, there have been significant efforts and additional controls implemented to address the risks as follows: (1)\\nenhancement of our revenue recognition policies, including training on the policies (2) implementation of project-level and accounting-level controls to\\nreview project costs, liquidated damages, and revenue calculations (3) implementation of effective controls over account analyses and reconciliations and\\n(4) hired additional resources and continue to hire to provide necessary expertise to continue to mature control environment.\\n\\nWe believe we are making progress toward achieving the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and\\nprocedures. The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as Audit Committee oversight. We are committed to\\nmaintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material\\nweakness are remediated as soon as possible. We will consider the material weakness remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period\\nof time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively.\\n\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nWe are taking actions to remediate the material weakness relating to our internal control over financial reporting. Other than the changes to our internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting described in “Material Weakness and Remediation Measures” above, there were no changes in our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially\\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\nOur independent registered accounting firm will not be required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant\\n\\nto Section 404 until we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act.\\n\\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\\n\\nOn November 11, 2022, the board of directors approved a restructuring plan to create a more sustainable organization structure for long term growth.\\nAs part of this restructuring plan, we will relocate certain positions in high-cost locations to the Fluence India Technology Centre. We expect that the\\nrestructuring plan will be complete by the end of fiscal year 2023. Management has the authority to expand the plan as determined necessary without\\nadditional board consent. We do not expect costs incurred to be material.\\n\\n110\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ITEM 10.

Each Financial Performance Goal\\nmay be assigned a weight and may be measured separately from any other Financial Performance Goals. Each Financial Performance Goal will\\ncontain the target achievement level (the “Financial Performance Goal Target”) required to earn 100% of the portion of the Incentive Award that is\\nbased on such Financial Performance Goal. The Incentive Award payout percentages for each of the respective Financial Performance Goals will\\ncontain the minimum or threshold, the Financial Performance Goal Target, and the maximum payout opportunity as determined by the Board or\\nCompensation Committee.

The  Incentive  Award  payout  percentages  for  each  of  the  respective  Strategic  Performance  Goals  will  contain  the\\nminimum or threshold, the Strategic Performance Goal Target, and the maximum payout opportunity as determined by the Board or Compensation\\nCommittee. The Board or Compensation Committee will determine the level of achievement of the Strategic Performance Goals in its discretion.\\nStrategic Performance Goals are typically measured on an annual basis but may be measured more or less frequently as determined by the Board\\nor Compensation Committee. The weight of each Strategic Performance Goal does not need to be the same for each Participant or for each Plan\\nYear.\\n\\n4.4        Individual  Performance  Objectives:  A  portion  of  the  Incentive  Award  may  be  based  on  the  achievement  of  one  or  more  Individual  Performance\\nObjectives.  The  Administrator  will  certify  the  achievement  of  the  Individual  Performance  Objectives  within  a  reasonable  period  following  the  close  of  the\\napplicable Plan Year. The direct manager of each Participant may set forth individual performance objectives for each Participant in the Plan (the “Individual\\nPerformance Objectives”). The Board or Compensation Committee has sole discretion regarding the use of Individual Performance Objectives, including, but\\nnot limited to, assigning a weight to each Individual Performance Objective, modifying the total amount of the Incentive Award earned by any Participant in a\\nPlan  Year  and  not  utilizing  any  Individual  Performance  Objectives  for  a  Participant  in  a  Plan  Year.  The  type,  weight  and  treatment  of  the  Individual\\nPerformance Objectives does not need to be the same for each Participant or for each Plan Year and will be determined on an individual basis by the Board\\nor Compensation Committee for each Plan Year. The Individual Performance Objectives are assessed using the Company’s individual performance rating\\nscale in effect during the applicable Plan Year. Individual Performance Objectives are typically measured on an annual basis but may be measured more or\\nless frequently as determined by the Administrator. The Administrator may set minimum or threshold, target and maximum payout opportunities with respect\\nto the achievement of Individual Performance Objectives.\\n\\n|US-DOCS\\\\136640243.2||\\n\\n                                                                                                                                  3 | Page\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##4.5        Target  Incentive  Percentage  and  Award  Levels:  A  Participant’s  Target  Incentive  Percentage  will  be  based  on  such  Participant’s  job  level  in  the\\nCompany.
