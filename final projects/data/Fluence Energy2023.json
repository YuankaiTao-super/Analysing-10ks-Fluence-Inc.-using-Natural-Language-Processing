Refer to\n\u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Key Operating Metrics\u201d for additional information\nregarding our deployed assets, contracted backlog, and pipeline.\n\nHistorical Background\n\nInitial Public Offering and Related Transactions\n\nOn November 1, 2021, the Company completed its initial public offering (the \u201cIPO\u201d) in which it issued and sold 35,650,000 shares of its Class A\ncommon stock, par value $0.00001 per share (\u201cClass A common stock\u201d), at the public offering price of $28.00 per share. The net proceeds to the Company\nfrom the IPO were $935.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company. In connection\nwith the IPO and related transactions consummated in connection therewith, we (i) recapitalized all existing ownership interests in Fluence Energy, LLC\ninto 135,666,665 limited liability interests (\u201cLLC Interests\u201d) and appointed Fluence Energy, Inc. as the sole managing member of Fluence Energy, LLC\nupon its acquisition of LLC Interests; (ii) issued to Qatar Holding, LLC (\u201cQHL\u201d), an affiliate of the Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund\nof Qatar (\u201cQIA\u201d), 18,493,275 shares of our Class A common stock as consideration in a series of mergers; (iii) issued 117,173,390 shares of our Class B-1\ncommon stock, par value $0.00001 per share (\u201cClass B-1 common stock\u201d) to the Founders, which was equal to the number of LLC Interests held by the\nFounders prior to the IPO, for nominal consideration; and (iv) used the net proceeds from the IPO to purchase 35,650,000 newly issued LLC Interests\ndirectly from Fluence Energy, LLC. For purposes of this Annual Report, \u201cContinuing Equity Owners\u201d shall refer to the Founders and QHL.\n\nSiemens Industry Redemption\n\nOn  June  30,  2022,  Siemens  Industry  exercised  its  redemption  right  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  Third  Amended  and  Restated  Limited  Liability\nCompany Agreement of Fluence Energy, LLC (the \u201cLLC Agreement\u201d) with respect to its entire holding of 58,586,695 LLC Interests of Fluence Energy,\nLLC,  together  with  the  corresponding  cancellation  of  an  equivalent  number  of  shares  of  Class  B-1  common  stock  (the  \u201cSiemens  Redemption\u201d).  The\nCompany elected to settle the Siemens Redemption through the issuance of 58,586,695 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock.\n\n3\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##As of September 30, 2023:\n\u2022 AES Grid Stability owns (1) 58,586,695 LLC Interests, representing approximately 33.0% of the economic interest in Fluence Energy, LLC and (2)\n58,586,695 shares of Class B-1 common stock of Fluence Energy, Inc., representing approximately 71.1% of the combined voting power of all of\nFluence Energy, Inc.\u2019s common stock;\n\n\u2022\n\nSiemens  beneficially  owns  58,586,695  shares  of  Class  A  common  stock  of  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.,  representing  approximately  14.2%  of  the\ncombined voting power of all of Fluence Energy, Inc.\u2019s common stock and approximately 49.3% of the economic interest in Fluence Energy, Inc.;\nand\n\n\u2022 QHL owns 18,493,275 shares of Class A common stock of Fluence Energy, Inc., representing approximately 4.5% of the combined voting power\n\nof all of Fluence Energy, Inc.\u2019s common stock and approximately 15.6% of the economic interest in Fluence Energy, Inc.\n\nOur Industry and Market Opportunity\n\nClimate change is an existential threat and there is currently an ongoing systemic global transition away from fossil fuels towards sustainable energy\nsystems. A major challenge that is threatening the rapid transition to a green economy is the lack of grid flexibility across the globe. Substantial portions of\nrenewable generation, unlike fossil fuel generation, is intermittent and can only be used in favorable wind and solar conditions. Energy storage is therefore\ncritical  in  unlocking  the  world\u2019s  clean  energy  transition  by  enabling  large-scale  adoption  of  24/7  renewable  energy  while  providing  the  resilience  and\nreliability required of energy infrastructure.\n\nEnergy storage is essential for building flexibility into power systems in a variety of ways including for energy shifting, as a peaking asset, for system\nstability, and for increasing grid utilization. According to the BloombergNEF 2H 2023 Energy Storage Market Outlook, annual front-of-the-meter additions\n(excluding projected utility-scale deployments in China) are on track to hit approximately 158 GWh by 2030.\n\nAdditionally, SaaS products for renewables and storage are critical for helping asset owners and managers navigate increasing market complexities. As\nportfolios  of  renewable  and  storage  assets  quickly  scale  across  the  globe,  asset  owners  and  managers  will  require  SaaS  products  that  optimize  the\nperformance of those assets to maximize their revenues and lower their overall cost of ownership.\n\nA significant emerging market opportunity is utilizing storage-as-a-transmission asset (SATA). We believe the world\u2019s operators of transmission and\ndistribution networks face a once-in-an-industry challenge as the rapid growth of distributed resources and renewable generation increase intermittency and\ncongestion and weaken system stability. These operators must maintain complete power system reliability even as generation technologies, power flows,\nand operational procedures undergo fundamental change. We expect the need for SATA to grow rapidly, as the massive expansion of renewable energy\nsources will increase grid congestion and consequently require more grid reinforcement and relief interventions. As the energy transition accelerates, energy\nproduction and consumption are becoming increasingly imbalanced. Grid expansion is necessary to transport energy generated in decentralized locations\nover  sometimes  long  distances.  At  the  same  time,  the  traditional  grid  expansion  must  be  supplemented  by  energy  storage  solutions  deployed  as  a\ntransmission asset to overcome the challenges for the transmission grid.\n\nGovernments across the globe have announced and implemented various policies, regulation, and legislation to support the transition from fossil fuels\nto low-carbon forms of energy including through the development and deployment of energy storage. For example, in August 2022, the United States passed\nthe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIRA\u201d), which includes a number of government incentives that support the adoption of energy storage products\nand  solutions  and  services  which  are  anticipated  to  benefit  the  Company  and  its  operations.  Such  government  policies  and  programs  are  becoming\nincreasingly instrumental in stimulating adoption of energy storage solutions across different markets through a variety of methods, including by providing\nfinancial  support,  facilitating  grid  integration,  supporting  research  and  development,  and  establishing  favorable  regulatory  regimes.  Refer  to  the\n\u201cGovernment Regulation and Compliance\u201d section below for further discussion.\n\nEnergy Storage Market Opportunity\n\nThe energy storage market is comprised of three elements:\n\u2022\n\nEnergy storage products and solutions\u2014 the components (including batteries), professional services, and labor required to manufacture, assemble,\nand install battery storage systems. The energy storage products and solutions market is driven by the deployment of new energy storage products\nand solutions globally, and its addressable market is comprised of the annual spend associated with the manufacturing, delivery, and installation of\nnew energy storage products and solutions. According to the 2H 2023 Energy Storage Market Outlook published by BloombergNEF in October\n2023, energy storage market is growing at a 27% compound annual growth rate to 2030, with annual additions reaching 110 GW/ 372 GWh or 2.6\ntimes expected 2023 gigawatt installations. As of October 2023, the long-duration energy storage commissioned capacity\n\n4\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##worldwide was 1.4 GW / 8.2 GWh. We believe most forecasts for the energy storage sector, including BloombergNEF\u2019s, understate the size and\nmarket opportunity as forecasts generally only account for spend associated with the physical energy storage asset and do not account  for  the\nassociated services and digital applications spend.\nServices \u2014 recurring operational and maintenance services that energy storage products and solutions require and asset management services that\nare provided by third parties when asset owners outsource the operations of their systems. The services market is driven by the growth in installed\nenergy storage products and solutions globally, and its addressable market is comprised of the recurring annual service spend across the entire fleet\nof energy storage projects, which is continuing to grow through new installations.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 Digital applications and software \u2014 controls systems and cloud-based software that help asset owners optimize the performance of their systems\nand portfolios, including asset performance management (APM) software and intelligent bidding software for asset trading. Cloud-based software\napplications  can  be  deployed  on  both  energy  storage  assets  and  renewable  and  conventional  generation  assets.  The  digital  applications  and\nsolutions sector is driven by the growth in installed energy storage products and solutions and renewable and conventional generation assets, and its\naddressable  market  is  comprised  of  the  total  global  installed  fleet  of  energy  storage  products  and  solutions  and  renewable  and  conventional\ngeneration assets. The digital applications and software economic model is primarily structured as (i) $/kilowatt (\u201ckW\u201d) recurring fixed fees, and in\nsome  cases  (ii)  $/kW  performance-based  incentive  fees  both  calculated  based  on  the  GWs  of  storage  and  generation  assets  on  which  digital\napplications and software service offerings are deployed. We believe there is an opportunity to not only deploy digital applications and software\nsolutions on individual assets but also across entire energy storage fleets and portfolios of generation assets to improve their collective performance\nand economic output, and to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the electric grid by optimizing the interactions between different asset types.\n\nWe believe there are multiple factors driving continued growth in the energy storage sector, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\n\nThe accelerating transition from fossil to renewable generation is expected to require significant increases in energy storage capacity to both offset\npotential grid instability caused by intermittent renewable resources and enable the use of power from renewable generation assets at times when\nthe natural resource is unavailable. Energy storage will be essential in managing variations in renewable electricity output.\n\n\u2022 Growing  capacity  constraints  on  existing  power  grids  that  were  not  designed  to  support  distributed  and  renewable  generation  infrastructure  or\n\ntechnologies, such as electric vehicles, are positioning energy storage assets as a key solution.\n\n\u2022\n\nEnvironmental responsibility has become a priority for companies and investors, with over 400 member companies having pledged to source 100%\nof their energy from renewables as part of the RE100, a global corporate renewable energy initiative.\n\n\u2022 Governments across the globe have announced legislation, policies, and initiatives to support the transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon forms of\n\nenergy and to support specifically energy storage deployment and development, including the United States through the passage of the IRA.\n\nOur Products and Services\n\nOur offerings include energy storage products and solutions, delivery services, recurring operational services and digital applications and solutions for\nenergy storage and other power assets. We may refer to our energy storage products as \u201cenergy storage solutions\u201d and use this term interchangeably as it is\nmore reflective of the full offering available and provided to our customers.

The Company is focused on transforming the way we power our world by helping customers create\nmore resilient and sustainable electric grids. We intend to further develop energy storage products, services, and digital software offerings into solutions that\nsolve our customers\u2019 energy challenges, and expand our services with additional value-add offerings. We also plan to add new customers as the number of\nIPPs, utilities and other key energy customers buying MWs of battery energy storage solutions grows substantially throughout the world. We aim to create\nan optimized production organization, continue to work to develop mass manufacturing facilities globally, and continue to secure partnerships with key\nbattery and component suppliers. We are also focused on expanding standardized offerings that are optimized for each of our sales channels and continuing\nto move towards a more localized, regional organizational structure to better support customers and sales channels, improve logistics, and enhance market\nfocus. Furthermore, we continue to explore disruptive digitally driven business models, including wide-ranging dynamic capacity, virtual storage, asset- and\nrevenue-sharing models, and other offerings.\n\nOur Customers\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we have deployed energy storage products and solutions in 33 markets in 25 countries. We sell our products to a wide range\nof customers around the world, including utilities and load-serving entities, IPPs, developers, conglomerates, and C&I customers. In fiscal year 2023, our\ntwo largest customers represented approximately 49% of our revenues. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, approximately 29% of our revenue was with\nrelated parties, primarily AES and its affiliates. As of September 30, 2023, we had a gross global pipeline of 50.3 GWs, of which includes 25.9 GWs for\nenergy storage products and services. Of the energy storage products and services global pipeline, United States customers composed the largest portion at\n7.5 GWs or approximately 32%, with Australia following at 5.3 GWs or 23% and the United Kingdom at 2.5 GWs or 11%.\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance    \n\nWe are a purpose-built, purpose-driven company on a mission to transform the way we power our world for a more sustainable future. The Company\u2019s\nenergy storage products and solutions, services, and digital software offerings are intended to enable more sustainable, reliable, and resilient electric grids\nand infrastructure in a repeatable, scalable way. Our internal Sustainability Program is built upon three key pillars: (i) Reporting & Stakeholder Engagement;\n(ii) Environmental Stewardship & Compliance; and (iii) Responsible Sourcing & Social Compliance. Fluence\u2019s Sustainability Program is governed by two\ninternal committees \u2013 our ESG Council and ESG Steering. These are cross functional leadership teams responsible for gathering alignment and support\nacross  the  organization  to  advance  our  ESG  initiatives.  The  ESG  Council  is  made  up  of  leadership  representing  key  internal  stakeholders  (including\nindividuals with subject-matter expertise in environment, supply chain, human resources, health and safety, legal, marketing, finance, and ethics). The ESG\nCouncil reports to our ESG Steering, which is comprised of five management leaders (our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Human\nResources Officer, Chief Supply Chain and Manufacturing Officer, and General Counsel).\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, we published our first annual sustainability report, which leveraged several ESG frameworks, such as Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (\u201cSASB\u201d) Fuel Cells & Industrial Batteries standard in addition to those standards promulgated by the Global Reporting Initiative (\u201cGRI\u201d).\nWe also incorporated the applicable United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) that we determined best aligned with our mission into the\nreport.\n\nOur responsible sourcing and compliance philosophy is based on the principles spelled out in our Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of\nConduct sets the social conduct expectations for all persons and entities connected to the Fluence value stream. Over the past few years, we have established\na Conflict Minerals Due Diligence Program and Supplier GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Emissions Disclosures. In fiscal year 2023, we published our Forced\nLabor Commitment letter that sets forth our stance as a company on forced labor.\n\n7\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##We  have  been  certified  against  the  ISO  14001  standard  at  our  office  in  Erlangen,  Germany  and  we  are  now  working  to  expand  our  ISO  14001\n\ncertification with the ultimate goal of certifying all relevant Fluence facilities.\n\nEmployees\n\nWe believe our workforce is critical to our success and we strive to create a positive, equitable, and safe work environment. To create a culture of\ntransparency, we maintain a regular cadence of communications from the executive leadership team to employees, including emails, all hands meetings,\nQ&A sessions, and employee resource groups with executive sponsors.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 1,112 full-time employees across 16 different countries. None of our employees in the United States\nare represented by a labor union. As of September 30, 2023, approximately 102 of our employees in Germany were represented by a works council. We\nhave not experienced any employment-related work stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. As of September 30, 2023, women\nrepresent 31% of our total workforce.\n\nFluence is committed to cultivating a diverse and inclusive culture. We believe that our purpose-driven culture has fostered a work environment in\nwhich employees feel supported, empowered to develop in their careers, and fulfilled in their work. Initiatives driven by this culture include professional\ndevelopment  courses  made  available  to  employees,  and  a  partnership  with  Inova  through  which  we  provide  free  professional  and  wellness  services  to\nemployees in the United States. To assess and continually improve employee sentiment, we conduct regular employee surveys soliciting feedback on topics\nsuch as work/life balance, working remotely, career development, and mentorship.\n\nFluence  is  internationally  certified  to  ISO  9001,  a  quality  management  standard  focused  on  commitment  to  customer  satisfaction,  purpose-driven\nleadership, and equitable involvement for all employees. Fluence is also internationally certified to ISO 45001, an occupational health and safety standard\nwhich requires certain proactive measures to promote employee safety and reduce workplace risks. Fluence\u2019s corporate headquarters is certified to SA8000,\nwhich demonstrates our commitment to the elimination of unethical and discriminatory labor practices, while affirming workers\u2019 rights, livable wages, and\ntreating all people with dignity.\n\nSafety\n\nWe  believe  that  Fluence  stands  out  as  a  leader  in  progressive  health,  safety,  and  environmental  management,  underpinned  by  our  commitment  to\nreducing hazards and minimizing risks. Our safety management system, anchored in a plan-do-check-act methodology, is intended to encourage the active\ninvolvement of stakeholders. Incorporated into our framework are our Fluence Code of Conduct and a stop work authorization. These tools are intended to\nempower our employees to voice safety concerns. By championing transparent communication, purposeful education, continuous training, and harnessing\nlessons from past experiences, we seek to empower our employees to not only meet but exceed Fluence's safety benchmarks.\n\nManufacturing\n\nOur manufacturing strategy is designed to meet certain key objectives: (i) limit capital-intensive and low value-added activities that can be outsourced\nto  other  companies,  (ii)  maintain  a  capital  light  business  model;  minimize  labor  content  where  possible,  (iii)  minimize  the  amount  of  assembly  our\ncustomers are required to do at any project site, and (iv) minimize material movement both from vendors to us and within factories.\n\nMass manufacturing is a cornerstone of our product delivery approach and a key to driving down product cost and delivering at scale. We aim to create\nan  optimized  production  organization,  develop  mass  manufacturing  capabilities  globally  through  contract  manufacturing,  and  continue  to  secure\npartnerships with key battery suppliers. We believe that enhancing our product-focused model and supply chain leverage will support our global growth\nobjectives and result in superior unit economics.\n\nWe have entered contracts with third party regional manufacturers for the assembly and production of our Fluence Cube, a key component of our energy\nstorage products. By using such regional contract manufacturers for assembly and production, we can drop ship products directly to designated warehouses\nor our customers\u2019 sites, which improves working capital turnover, quality, and inventory management.\n\nIn September 2022, we partnered with one such contract manufacturer to open a new manufacturing facility in the United States to better serve regional\ndelivery and address supply chain constraints. The facility is located in Utah and serves the Company\u2019s customers in North America. The addition of this\ncontract manufacturing facility expands our assembly and production beyond Asia to meet increasing global demand and allow Fluence to better serve\nregional  markets.  We  intend  to  expand  manufacturing  capabilities  to  sites  in  India  and  Europe.  We  intend  to  continue  to  select  strategic  contract\nmanufacturers that have global presence to maintain continuity in our business model.\n\nFluence has also created two spare parts hubs in Europe and the United States to support ongoing operations and maintenance of its customers\u2019 storage\n\nassets. These hubs, located in Utah and Ireland, both became operational in fiscal year 2022, and are\n\n8\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##strategically  positioned  near  large  storage  markets  and  customer  fleets.  We  are  also  currently  exploring  opening  two  additional  spare  parts  third  party\nlogistics hubs in the APAC region.\n\nSupply Chain\n\nWe have developed a global supply chain with an evolving regionally focused operational model with the objective of allowing us to assemble products\nin  proximity  to  major  markets  to  minimize  material  movement,  working  capital  investment,  and  costs  of  goods  sold.  Additionally,  we  believe  that  the\nvolume of key components we purchase, such as lithium-ion batteries, should provide us leverage to create a competitive advantage on availability, terms,\nand pricing from our suppliers. We have a technology co-development and supply agreement with Northvolt that will expand our battery supply chain into\nEurope. Pursuant to this agreement, we have a license to develop, manufacture and commercialize an optimized battery subsystem that is significantly more\nenergy  dense  than  today\u2019s  standard  solutions.  The  agreement  also  enables  us  to  deploy  a  battery  management  system  that  can  be  integrated  with  other\nvendors to extend our value chain, develop battery competencies, and lower total cost of ownership. In August 2023, we announced the signing of a battery\nsupply agreement with AESC, under which Fluence will procure U.S. manufactured battery cells as well, which positions Fluence with the ability to provide\ncustomers with a storage product that we anticipate will qualify for the 10% ITC bonus for using domestic content under the IRA under the U.S. Department\nof Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service Notice 2023-38, Domestic Content Bonus Credit Guidance under Sections 45, 45Y, 48 and 48E (the \u201cNotice\u201d),\nwhich set forth the requirements to qualify for the domestic content bonus credit of up to 10% on top of the ITC and CEITC (as defined below); provided,\nthat more clarity is still needed on aspects of the IRA, including the domestic content guidelines, and there is no guarantee that we will realize any or all of\nthe anticipated benefits of incentives under the IRA.\n\nOur energy storage products incorporate various raw materials including, but not limited to, steel, aluminum, copper, nickel, iron phosphate, graphite,\nmanganese, lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, and cobalt. These raw materials form an essential and integral part of our energy storage products and\nservices. Pricing for these materials is governed in large part by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as\nglobal supply and demand and market speculation.\n\nAlthough we do not rely on any single supplier for the majority of our key components, we do obtain certain key components from a limited number of\nsuppliers. If one or more suppliers were unable to satisfy our requirements for particular key components, including the increasing number of regulatory\nrequirements regarding products\u2019 environmental, social, and/or geographic provenance, we could experience a disruption to our operations as alternative\nsuppliers are identified and qualified and new supply arrangements are entered into. Moreover, if one of our suppliers is unable to satisfy our requirements\nand we turn to another supplier, they may ask for terms that are advantageous to them at higher costs to the Company. In addition, a large portion of our\nsuppliers are situated outside of the United States, which exposes us to changes in international trade regulations, taxes, tariffs, and/or quotas. As of the date\nof this Annual Report, we believe that we have adequate access to our key components to meet the needs of our operations.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nThe success of our business depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property, some of which include patents,\npatentable ideas, methods, and technologies, proprietary information, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, processes and know-how. We rely primarily on a\ncombination  of  patent,  trademark,  copyright,  unfair  competition,  and  trade  secret  laws,  as  well  as  confidentiality  agreements  and  procedures  and  other\ncontractual arrangements with our employees, contractors, and third parties, to establish, maintain, and protect our methods, technology, and our proprietary\nrights. Fluence also has a perpetual license (terminable in the event of an uncured material breach) to certain patents and other intellectual property that\nbelong to AES and Siemens, including methods for cooling inverters, overvoltage protections, and transfer of large amounts of data (methodology).\n\nAs of September 2023, we held over 150 granted patents worldwide and had over 60 patent applications pending with domestic and foreign patent\n\noffices. As of September 2023, we also had over 95 registered trademarks with domestic and foreign trademark offices.\n\nAdditionally, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary know-how and\nsoftware that is not patented and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce. We believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve\nproprietary know-how, technology, or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs,\nalgorithms,  and  procedures.  We  pursue  intellectual  property  protection  that  is  aligned  and  advantageous  to  our  business  objectives  and  we  require  our\ncustomers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans. We\nmay  take  legal  action  to  prevent  third  parties  from  infringing  or  misappropriating  our  intellectual  property  or  from  otherwise  gaining  access  to  our\ntechnology.\n\n9\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Seasonality\n\nWe  have  historically  experienced  seasonality  and  see  increased  order  intake  in  our  third  and  fourth  fiscal  quarters  (April  \u2013  September),  driven  by\ndemand in the Northern Hemisphere to install energy storage products and solutions before the summer of the following year. Combined third and fourth\nfiscal quarter order intake has historically accounted for 80% or more of our total intake each year prior to fiscal year 2022. However, combined third and\nfourth fiscal quarter order intake accounted for 48% and 43% of our total annual intake for fiscal year 2022 and 2023, respectively. In fiscal year 2024, we\ncurrently expect seasonality to return, such that our order intake in the combined third and fourth is expected to be higher than in the first half of the year.\nOur services and digital applications offerings have not historically experienced seasonality given their recurring nature.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe energy storage industry is competitive and continuously evolving. Our energy storage products and solutions, services, and digital applications are\nhighly specialized and specific to the clean energy industry. The unique expertise required to design these offerings as well as integrate these solutions for\nour customers can be very complex and technical, however, the number of additional companies offering similar products and services is growing every\nyear. In addition, we are continuously engaging in developing new use cases and opening new market segments, which are often less contested. We believe\nthat competitive factors in the energy storage market include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nsafety, reliability and quality;\nstability in supply chain;\nperformance of energy storage products and solutions, services and digital applications;\nhistorical customer track record (as the market and industry continues to grow);\nexperience in the battery energy storage system market (both of the Company and key members of leadership);\ntechnological expertise and innovation;\ncomprehensive solutions and offerings from a single provider;\nbrand recognition;\ncertain government initiatives, legislation, regulations, and policies;\nease of integration; and\nseamless hardware and software-enabled service offerings.\n\nOther  companies  currently  operating  in  the  battery  energy  storage  system  space  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  Tesla,  Inc.,  Wartsila  Corporation,\nSungrow Power Supply Co., Ltd. and Powin Energy Corporation. Our competition varies by geography, country, grid service, and customer segment. There\nis  a  rising  demand  for  energy  storage  products  and  solutions  globally,  and  with  that  growing  demand,  we  see  increasing  numbers  of  new  entrants  and\npotential entrants in the energy storage space. We believe that a key differentiator for Fluence from our competitors is our ability to identify customer needs\nand deliver customer-centric products, services, and use cases that can compete in the market either as packages or standalone offerings. We believe we\ncompete  favorably  based  on  performance  and  value-creation,  including  low  total  cost  of  ownership,  long-term  reliability,  varied  service  options,  and\nconvenient and efficient sales and delivery processes.\n\nGovernment Regulation and Compliance\n\nU.S. Greenhouse Gas Emission Related Policies, Regulation and Legislation\n\nGovernments across the globe have announced and implemented various policies, regulation, and legislation to support the transition from fossil fuels\nto low-carbon forms of energy and the infrastructure around that transition. The operation of our business and our customers\u2019 use of our products and\nsolutions and services as well as our digital applications are, and may in the future be, impacted by these various government actions. For example, the\nUnited  States  rejoined  the  Paris  Agreement  effective  February  19,  2021,  an  international  climate  change  agreement  among  almost  200  nations  and  the\nEuropean Union, that established a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and\nwhich calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve these targets. In\nAugust 2022, the United States passed the IRA, which consists of a number of provisions aimed directly at confronting the climate change crisis. The\nclimate-related provisions of the IRA are projected to cut emissions by up to 40% from 2005 GHG levels in the United States by 2030. Among other things,\nthe IRA introduced an ITC for standalone energy storage, which is anticipated to lower capital cost of equipment. The IRA also contains provisions with\nincentives for grid modernization equipment, including domestic battery cell manufacturing, battery module manufacturing and its components as well as\nvarious upstream applications. Additional information regarding the tax incentives contained in the IRA are set forth below in \u201cEnergy Storage Regulation\nand Legislation\u201d. These types of regulations incentivize the adoption of renewable energy technologies, including energy storage products.\n\n10\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Non-U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emission Related Policies, Regulation and Legislation\n\nInternationally, in June 2021, the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals (the \u201cFit for 55 package\u201d) as part of the European\nGreen Deal, which encompasses a number of wide-scale proposals aimed at reducing European GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 and targeting net-zero\nemissions by 2050. Moreover, the European Commission proposed the REPowerEU Plan in May 2022, which is centered around the goal of making Europe\nindependent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030, in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine early in 2022. It is meant to incentivize and accelerate the\ntransition to clean energy alternatives and aims to increase the security of energy supply by building and connecting more renewable generation to the grid.\n\nIn March 2023, the European Commission launched their proposal for the Net Zero Industrial Plan (NZIA), which aims to improve the competitiveness\nof the European clean tech industry. Within the proposed NZIA, batteries as well as energy storage technologies have been net-zero technologies. This\nclassification may in the future allow for improved permitting processes and easier state aid funding for manufacturing facilities for these and other net-zero\ntechnologies. The draft proposal also introduces the possibility of sustainability and resiliency contributions in public procurement procedures as well as in\nauctions to deploy renewable energy sources. As the legislation is in negotiations with the Council of the EU and the European Parliament at this time, the\nexact  magnitude  of  the  impact  on  the  clean  energy  industry  and  the  Company  is  yet  to  be  defined,  however  a  strengthening  of  the  clean  technology\nmanufacturing sector in Europe can be seen as a positive development for energy storage, as the acceleration of renewable energy production in Europe\ncreates stronger demand for energy storage for the integration of increasing shares of renewable energy.\n\nIn September 2022, Australia passed climate change legislation containing a targeted 43% reduction in the emissions intensity of its economy of 2005\nGHG  levels  by  2030  and  a  reduction  to  net-zero  emissions  by  2050  and  some  of  its  specific  states  have  their  own  targets,  including  Victoria\u2019s  95%\nrenewable regeneration by 2035 target and 2.6 GW energy storage by 2030. Additionally, in December 2022, Australia agreed in principle to establish the\nCapacity Investment Scheme which is intended to provide a national framework to encourage new investment in clean dispatchable capacity to support\nreliability and affordability in Australia\u2019s energy market and parts of the program are a significant step for the government to underwrite many new storage\nprojects by offering a revenue floor and revenue sharing mechanism to address reliability as GWs of coal-fired power plants retire.\n\nIn  August  2022,  India  revised  its  previous  pledge  to  achieve  a  33 \u2013 35%  reduction  in  emissions  intensity  by  2030  and  has  committed  to  reduce\nemissions intensity by 45% of 2005 GHG levels by 2030 and to achieve about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based\nenergy resources by 2030 as well as achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. In April 2021, the Philippines committed to a projected GHG emissions\nreduction and avoidance of 75%, of which 2.71% is unconditional, for the period 2020 to 2030 for the sectors of agriculture, wastes, industry, transport, and\nenergy.\n\nCurrent  legislation  and  regulation  addressing  climate  change  is  making  lower  GHG-emitting  energy  sources,  such  as  solar  and  wind,  increasingly\ndesirable to consumers compared to higher GHG-emitting energy sources, such as coal and natural gas and could continue to do so into the future. As a\nresult, legislation and regulations with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions may potentially increase the demand for energy storage products and\nrelated services.\n\nU.S. Energy Storage Regulation and Legislation\n\nThe U.S. Congress is continuously reviewing and passing various climate change proposals, incentives, regulations, and legislation that may support the\nenergy storage industry, including in the form of tax credits and incentives. We cannot guarantee we will realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of\nincentives under any such enacted regulations or legislation, including the IRA. IRS private letter ruling 201809003 clarified that energy storage is eligible\nfor federal tax credits if charged primarily by qualifying renewable resources. In December 2020, the U.S. Congress passed a spending bill that included\n$35 billion in energy research and development programs, a two-year extension of the ITC for solar power, a one-year extension of the production tax credit\nfor  wind  power  projects,  and  an  extension  through  2025  for  offshore  wind  tax  credits.  The  Infrastructure  Investment  and  Jobs  Act,  also  known  as  the\nBipartisan Infrastructure Bill, which was signed into law in November 2021, allocated nearly $7 billion to strengthen the U.S. battery supply chain, which\nincludes producing and recycling critical minerals without new extraction or mining and sourcing materials for domestic manufacturing. Pursuant to this, in\nOctober 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) selected twenty companies to receive $2.8 billion to boost production of the advanced batteries that\nare critical to the clean energy industry, including energy storage and which intended to support the creation of new domestic manufacturing facilities for\nbatteries and cell components and to support research and development for recycling, reclaiming and adding materials back into the battery supply chain,\nwhich further creates the demand and market for energy storage solutions here in the United States.\n\nThe  IRA  adopted  in  August  2022  contains  a  number  of  tax  incentive  provisions  that  directly  support  the  adoption  of  energy  storage  products  and\nservices. Before the enactment of the IRA, the Section 48 ITC did not apply to standalone energy storage projects. The IRA added Section 48(a)(3)(A)(ix) to\ncreate an ITC for standalone energy storage technology with a minimum capacity of 5 kWh. Energy storage installations that are placed in service after\nDecember 31, 2022 and begin construction prior to January 1, 2025, are entitled to the existing ITC under Section 48(a). To qualify for the ITC bonus rate of\n30%, an energy storage project will need to satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. If these requirements are not met, the project will\nbe eligible\n\n11\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##only for a base rate of 6%. The existing energy ITC will be replaced by a Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (CEITC) or \u201ctech neutral\u201d regime, which\nis  available  for  any  investment  in  a  qualified  storage  facility  that  is  placed  in  service  after  calendar  year  2024  (prevailing  wage  and  apprenticeship\nrequirements  will  still  apply).  We  believe  we  are  well  positioned  to  capture  incentives  contained  in  the  IRA  with  our  forthcoming  battery  module\nmanufacturing, as we opened a contract manufacturing facility in Utah, our second facility globally, to better serve regional delivery and address ongoing\nsupply chain constraints alongside our supply agreement for U.S. manufactured battery cells with AESC. However, as the IRA was adopted in August 2022\nand the Notice was published in the second half of 2023, we have not yet seen the impact these IRA related incentives may have on our business operations\nand financial performance as we go forward and more clarity in particular is needed on certain aspects of the IRA, including the domestic content guidelines\nand scope of the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements for all aspects of our projects.\n\nOther Policy Initiatives including Tax Incentives, Cash Grants and Performance Incentives\n\nThere are varying other policy initiatives designed to support and accelerate adoption of clean and/or reliable distributed generation technologies. These\npolicy initiatives can come in the form of tax incentives, cash grants, performance incentives, and/or electric tariffs. We cannot guarantee though that we\nwill realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of any of these policy initiatives.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, in the United States, our energy storage products are installed or in delivery in a number of states, including, but not limited\nto, Arizona, California, Colorado, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia,\nand each state has its own enabling policy framework, which is subject to change. Some states have utility procurement programs, energy storage mandates,\ntargets or goals, and/or renewable portfolio standards for which our technology is eligible. Many states, including California, Massachusetts, and New York,\noffer tax exemptions or other customer incentives.\n\nAlthough we generally are not regulated as a utility, federal, state, and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence\nthe market for our product and services. These statutes and regulations often relate to electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, competition with\nutilities  and  the  interconnection  of  customer-owned  electricity  generation.  In  the  United  States,  governments  continuously  modify  these  statutes  and\nregulations. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different rates for commercial (and residential)\ncustomers on a regular basis. These changes can have a positive or negative impact on our ability to deliver cost savings to customers for the purchase of\nelectricity.\n\nAs noted, several states in the United States have an energy storage mandate or policies designed to encourage the adoption of storage, including eleven\nstates with specific energy storage targets. For example, Virginia has a mandate for 3.1 GW of energy storage by 2035, California offers a cash rebate for\nstorage installations through the Self Generation Incentive Program, and Massachusetts and New York offer performance-based financial incentives for\nstorage. In 2023, Maryland established an energy storage target of 750 MW by year end 2027, 1.5 GW through 2030 and 3 GW through 2033. Other states,\nincluding Michigan and Vermont, are studying or proposing energy storage deployment policies and there are likely further energy storage mandates coming\nas they have been introduced in state legislatures over the course of the last year. Storage installations also are supported in certain states by state public\nutility commission policies that require utilities to consider alternatives such as storage in integrated resource planning proceedings before they can build\nnew generation. Our customers benefit directly under these programs. Our business is directly benefited by the adoption of such mandates or policies, which\ncreate a greater demand among customers in the United States for such energy storage solutions.\n\nIn  addition,  in  Europe,  the  European  Commission  has  published  a  proposal  for  reform  of  the  Electricity  Market  Design,  which  is  currently  in\nnegotiations with the Council of the EU and the European Parliament. Under the European Commission\u2019s proposal, member states would be required to\nassess  flexibility  needs  of  their  electricity  systems  for  the  following  five  years  in  view  of  the  need  to  cost  effectively  achieve  security  of  supply  and\ndecarbonize their power systems. Based on these assessments, the new market design would introduce a requirement for national governments to define\nindicative national objectives for demand response and energy storage and reflect those objectives in their respective national energy and climate plans. In\norder to realize those objectives, member states would be able to strengthen the role of energy storage in national capacity/resource adequacy mechanisms,\nor implement flexibility support schemes consisting of payments for the available capacity of non-fossil flexibility such as demand response and storage.\nThe draft nature of current legislation and lack of clarity on secondary legislation, including the methodology for national flexibility mechanisms, make the\nimpact of such proposed reform on our business difficult to predict.\n\nIn March 2023, the European Commission passed the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework for State Aid Measures, in which it established the\npossibility of CAPEX and OPEX funding mechanism for energy storage on a member state level. Such mechanisms have been implemented by several\nEuropean countries over the last 12 months. For such mechanisms, the European Commission has approved at least 1.9 million Euros in state aid since\nSeptember 2022. We believe that mechanisms such as these will impact adoption of energy storage solutions.\n\n \nAdditionally,  there  are  certain  European  country  specific  initiatives  that  have  historically  helped  the  adoption  of  clean  energy  and  energy  storage\nsolutions. For instance, in Germany, Section 118 (6), sentence 1 of the Energy Industry Act provides an exemption from network charges in the case of\nnewly constructed facilities for storing electrical energy. Facilities are considered newly\n\n12\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##constructed if they were or are commissioned within a period of 15 years starting from August 4, 2011, and the exemption lasts through August 2026.\n\nFERC Support of Energy Storage\n\nThe  U.S.  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (\u201cFERC\u201d)  has  taken  a  number  of  steps  to  help  to  enable  the  participation  of  energy  storage  in\nwholesale  energy  markets.  For  example,  in  February  2018,  FERC  issued  Order  841  directing  regional  transmission  operators  and  independent  system\noperators  to  remove  barriers  to  the  participation  of  storage  in  wholesale  electricity  markets  and  to  establish  rules  to  help  ensure  storage  resources  are\ncompensated for the services they provide. Order 841 was upheld in July 2020 following an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, with\nthe court finding that FERC\u2019s directives to allow distributed storage participation in wholesale electricity markets did not violate the Federal Power Act\u2019s\njurisdictional line separating FERC\u2019s authority over those markets and states\u2019 authority over local distribution facilities. In September 2020, FERC issued\nOrder 2222 opening U.S. wholesale energy markets to aggregations of distributed energy resources like rooftop solar, \u201cbehind the meter\u201d batteries, and\nelectric vehicles. In July 2023, FERC issued Order 2023, which is intended to speed up the process of connecting new energy projects to the grid due to the\nbacklog of more than 10,000 energy projects awaiting interconnection in the United States. It includes more stringent deadlines and has adjusted processes\nthat  had  previously  created  barriers  to  battery  projects  obtaining  interconnection  and  improves  interconnection  procedures  with  elements  such  as  more\naccurate operational modeling of energy storage in interconnection studies.\n\nEnergy  storage  products  require  interconnection  agreements  from  the  applicable  authorities  having  jurisdiction  to  operate.  In  almost  all  cases,\ninterconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with\njurisdiction over interconnection agreements. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are typically required once interconnection agreements are signed.\n\nOther Policies, Regulation, and Legislation\n\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our\nemployees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, and\ncomparable U.S. state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety as well as comparable international laws that aim to protect and regulate\nemployee health and safety.\n\nChanges in or adoption of domestic policies and policy initiatives, legislation and regulations on a federal, state, and local level as well as changes in or\nadoption of policies and policy initiatives, regulations and legislation in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may pose risks or provide opportunities\nfor the Company\u2019s business that may impact our future operations and financial condition. For more information about the potential risks of adoption or\nchanges to such policies, legislation and regulations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nPermits and Approvals\n\nEach of our installations or customer installations must be designed, constructed, and operated in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local\nlaws, regulations, codes, standards, and guidelines. To install and operate energy storage products and solutions on our platform, we, our customers, or our\npartners,  as  may  be  applicable,  are  required  to  obtain  and  maintain  applicable  permits  and  approvals  from  the  relevant  appropriate  governmental  or\nregulatory authorities having jurisdiction to install energy storage products and solutions and to interconnect the products with the local electrical utility.\n\nCorporate Information\n\nWe file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and\nCurrent  Reports  on  Form  8-K,  proxy  statements  and  other  information  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (\u201cSEC\u201d).  In  addition,  the  SEC\nmaintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.\nOur website is located at https://fluenceenergy.com and our reports, amendments thereto, proxy statements and other information are also made available,\nfree of charge, on our investor relations website at https://ir.fluenceenergy.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such\ninformation with the SEC.

Business\n\nOur limited operating and revenue history as an independent entity and the nascent clean energy industry in which we operate makes evaluating our\nbusiness and future prospects difficult.\n\nWe were established in January 2018 as a joint venture between Siemens and AES. Since then, we have continued to evolve, grow and expand our\nbusiness and operations. We have benefited and continue to benefit from the industry experience and support AES and Siemens have provided and continue\nto provide, but we have a limited history operating our business and generating revenue as an independent entity, and therefore a limited history upon which\nyou can base an investment decision. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks by companies in the earlier stages of development, especially\nthose in newer and rapidly evolving markets. Our ability to plan for future operations, predict future results of operations, and plan for and model future\ngrowth in revenue and expenses and prospects is subject to significant risk and uncertainty as compared to companies with longer and more consistent\noperating histories and in more stable macroeconomic environments and industries.\n\nOur potential future growth in a nascent and rapidly-evolving industry is dependent on a number of factors, including rising demand for clean electric\npower solutions that can provide electric power with lower carbon emissions and replacement of conventional generation sources and the adoption speed of\ndigital software applications to modernize the efficiency of power assets and the electric grid. Among other renewable energy market trends, we expect our\nbusiness results to be driven by declines in the cost of generation of renewable power, decreases in the cost of manufacturing battery modules and cells,\ncustomer needs for related services and digital applications, commercial, legal, and political pressure for the reduced use of and reliance on fossil fuels and\nelectric power generation that relies on fossil or other non-renewable fuels, regulatory and governmental incentives towards reduced use of fossil fuels and\nincreased  use  of  renewable  energy  and  energy  storage  solutions,  and  a  rapidly  growing  energy  storage  market  driven  by  increasing  demand  from  C&I\ncustomers, IPPs, developers, utilities, and grid operators. However, predicting future revenues and appropriately forecasting and budgeting for our expenses\nis difficult, and we have limited insight into trends or economic conditions that may emerge and take hold and materially affect our business. Our future\noperations and growth strategy is therefore subject to all of the risks inherent in light of the expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently\nencountered in connection with the growth of any new business in a nascent industry, as well as those that are specific to our business in particular as which\nare further described herein.\n\nIf our assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties that we consider in planning and operating our business are incorrect or change, or if we do not\naddress these risks and uncertainties successfully, including due to the lack of historical data from and experience in operating our business at its current\nscale, as well as the evolution of our business, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations, and our business and our financial\ncondition could be adversely affected.\n\n15\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##We  have  a  history  of  net  losses  and  we  anticipate  increasing  expenses  in  the  future,  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  achieve  or  maintain  prolonged\nprofitability.\n\nWe have incurred net losses on an annual basis since our inception. We incurred net losses of $104.8 million and $289.2 million during the fiscal years\nended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect our aggregate costs will increase substantially in the foreseeable future and our losses will\ncontinue as we expect to continue to invest heavily in increasing our customer base, expanding our operations, and operating as a public company. These\nefforts  may  prove  more  expensive  than  we  currently  anticipate,  and  we  may  not  succeed  in  increasing  our  revenue  sufficiently  to  offset  these  higher\nexpenses.  To  date,  we  have  financed  our  operations  with  equity  contributions  from  AES  Grid  Stability,  Siemens  Industry,  and  QHL,  cash  and  cash\nequivalents, negative working capital, and short-term borrowings. Our net cash flow from operations was $(111.9) million and $(282.4) million for each of\nthe fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We may not generate positive cash flow from operations or profitability in the near future\nor in any given period, and our limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate our current business and our future prospects. Operating\nresults for future periods are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks and we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain prolonged profitability.\nOur ability to achieve or maintain prolonged profitability in the future depends on a number of factors, including the continued successful development and\ncustomer acceptance of our energy storage products and solutions, services, and digital applications, our ability to obtain components from suppliers on\ncost-effective terms on a timely basis, our ability to maintain and grow our market share, as well as our ability to effectively manage both our operating\nexpenditures and our capital expenditures.\n\nWe have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in new and rapidly changing\nindustries, including increasing expenses as we continue to expand our business. We expect our operating expenses to continue to increase significantly over\nthe  next  several  years  as  we  continue  to  hire  additional  personnel,  expand  our  operations  and  infrastructure,  and  continue  to  expand  to  reach  more\ncustomers. In addition to the expected costs to grow our business, we also expect to incur additional legal, accounting, compliance, and other expenses as a\nnewer public company. These investments may be more costly than we expect, and if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or\nif the realization of these benefits is delayed, they may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. Further, we may encounter unforeseen\noperating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other factors as we expand our business, execute our business plans and navigate macroeconomic\nuncertainty, which may result in losses or a failure to generate profitable growth in future periods. If our growth rate were to decline significantly or become\nnegative, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to achieve or maintain positive cash flow in the long\nterm, we may require additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and/or which would be dilutive to our stockholders. Our\nability to obtain any such additional financing is subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor and customer acceptance of\nour business model and our products and market and stakeholder confidence in our ability to perform against our business plans.\n\nIf we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, results of operations and financial condition may\nbe adversely affected. Our failure to achieve and/or maintain prolonged profitability could negatively impact the value of our Class A common stock and the\nvalue of our business.\n\nWe  may  experience  difficulties  in  establishing  mass  manufacturing  capacity  and  estimating  potential  cost  savings  and  efficiencies  from  anticipated\nimprovements to our manufacturing capabilities.\n\nWhile our manufacturing output achieved to date is already at commercial scale, it is a fraction of what we expect will be necessary to fully meet the\ndemand we see in the market for our energy storage products. Although, we are currently on track to meet our internal corporate initiatives related to mass\nmanufacturing in fiscal year 2024, the manufacturing process for our expected full commercial scale is still being refined and improved. There are risks\nassociated with scaling up manufacturing to larger commercial volumes including, among others, technical or other problems with process scale-up, process\nreproducibility, stability issues, quality consistency, timely availability of raw materials, supply chain delays and bottlenecks, cost overruns, and adequate\ndefinitions or qualifications for safety, reliability, and quality. In addition, in connection with our limited operating history and our significant growth, we\nhave in the past experienced and may in the future experience incurrence of project costs without proper documentation or adhering to our policies and\nprocedures. There is no assurance that our manufacturers will be successful in establishing and then maintaining larger-scale commercial manufacturing\nprocesses that achieves our objectives for manufacturing capacity and cost per battery, in a timely manner or at all or that they will be able to maintain such\nprocesses over time. We are in the process of qualifying a few potential additional manufacturers, which we anticipate will provide business continuity and\ngreater flexibility in our supply chain. However, if such new manufacturers are not qualified and then onboarded in a timely manner, or if they fail to\nprovide products that meet our expectations, then our business and results of operations may suffer. If we are unable to produce sufficient quantities of\nproducts on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner, the Company\u2019s commercialization efforts would be impaired which could materially adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n\n16\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##We have experienced and may continue to experience delays, disruptions, and/or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations in part due\nto our third-party manufacturer concentration, which may in turn adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or future\nprospects.\n\nOur product development, manufacturing, and testing protocols are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise. We\ncurrently depend on a limited number of third-party manufacturers, including for key components of our energy storage products. As of today, we have two\nmajor contract manufacturers for the Fluence Cube, including one manufacturer who provides fabrication, integration, assembly and/or full turnkey services\nto Fluence depending on location of customer site. We also maintain a final assembly facility for the Fluence Cube with the second manufacturer in Utah,\nserving only customers in the Americas region. We are also in the process of qualifying new manufacturers in both India and the Americas and are planning\nto continue to expand our set of partners in the near term. Qualifying new manufacturers can be a lengthy, time-consuming process and we may not be able\nto qualify manufacturers on the timeline we anticipate, if at all, which would lead us to rely more heavily on our existing manufacturers and their current\noperating abilities. If our current manufacturers are unable to keep up with our demand, this may impact our ability to meet deadlines for our customers and\nmay lead to adverse effects to our brand. As we introduce new products, we plan to continue to evaluate the economic benefits to Fluence and will expand\nour  regional  manufacturing  capabilities  to  further  support  customers  in  in  all  regions.  Moreover,  we  continue  our  Americas  regional  manufacturing\ncapabilities and will further develop the EMEA and India markets once demand targets are achieved. Any vendor delay or disruption could cause a delay or\ndisruption in our ability to meet customer requirements which may result in a loss of customers.\n\nSuch processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production. Any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors,\nrequiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched, identified, and properly addressed and rectified. This\nmay occur particularly as we introduce new products, modify our engineering and production techniques, and/or expand our capacity. In addition, our failure\nto maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures, loss of customers, increased warranty reserve, or increased\nproduction and logistics costs, delays and liquidated damages to our customers. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, and our future prospects.\n\nWe are dependent on our existing suppliers and face supply chain competition and, in some instances, have entered into long-term supply agreements\nthat could result in insufficient inventory and negatively affect our results of operations.\n\nWe  have  executed  long-term  supply  agreements  with  certain  battery  and  inverter  suppliers.  Our  suppliers\u2019  caution  and  uncertainty  in  their  own\ndownstream supply chains has resulted in a variety of pricing mechanisms designed to mitigate unforeseen fluctuations in materials availability and pricing.\nFor  instance,  some  of  these  supply  agreements  provide  for  substantial  prepayment  obligations  and  committed  volumes  to  ensure  source  of  supply  and\nfavorable pricing and payment terms, which impacts our working capital resources. If our suppliers provide insufficient inventory at the level of quality or\nprovenance required to meet customer or regulatory requirements, or if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to provide us with the contracted quantities at\nthe  contracted  prices,  or  if  there  are  unexpected  changes  in  business  conditions,  including  inflation  of  raw  material  costs,  labor  issues,  wars,  natural\ndisasters, pandemics, trade and shipping disruptions, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers\u2019 control which affect our supplier\u2019s ability to deliver\nadequate inventory of components to us, our results of operations could be materially and negatively impacted. If our customers do not provide sufficient\ndemand  to  purchase  the  levels  of  inventory  we  have  committed  to  purchasing  in  future  periods  under  such  supply  agreements,  our  ability  to  generate\nrevenue or cash flows may be limited.\n\nNew supply agreements with established suppliers in the battery and inverter industries present a potential period of growing pains as we launch new\nenergy storage product offerings. Supply arrangements with new entrants to the energy storage industry also pose risks due to their production planning and\nramp up operations as well as the unknown quality of their offerings. New market entrants who do not have a long operating history may have financial\nchallenges raising working capital and possess operating risks. In the event any such supplier experiences financial difficulties, it may be difficult or may\nrequire substantial time and expense to replace such supplier. The opportunity costs of engaging with new industry participants may therefore outweigh the\nperceived  benefits.  Insufficient  inventory  to  meet  customer  expectations  may  impact  negatively  on  our  brand  and  industry  sentiment.  We  do  not  know\nwhether we will be able to maintain long-term supply relationships with our critical suppliers or secure new long-term supply agreements. Additionally, a\nlarge proportion of our battery and inverter suppliers are situated outside of the United States, which exposes us to changes in applicable international trade\nregulations,  such  as  taxes,  tariffs,  or  quotas.  Any  of  the  foregoing  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  of\noperations.\n\nWe may also be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to\nterms. Global demand has increased for lithium-ion battery cells, which may cause challenges for our suppliers, including delays, inventory shortages, or\nprice volatility. Any such delays or reduced availability of components may impact our sales and operating results.\n\n17\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##We face risks resulting from supplier and contract manufacturer concentration and limited supplier and contract manufacturer capacity.\n\nWe rely on a small number of suppliers and contract manufacturers. Switching suppliers or contract manufacturers can be costly and disruptive to\nbusiness operations and would require a longer-term strategic approach. If any of our suppliers or contract manufacturers is unable or unwilling to provide\nus with contracted quantities in a timely manner at prices, quality levels (including environmental, social, and/or geographic provenance), and volumes\nacceptable to us and which are contracted for, we would have limited alternatives for supply and manufacturing, and we may not be able to contract for and\nreceive suitable alternative supply or manufacturing abilities in a timely manner for our customers, if at all. Such an event may impair our ability to meet\nscheduled deliveries of our products to customers, which may cause our customers to cancel orders and subject us to liability and potential litigation and\nmay  materially  adversely  affect  our  customer  relationships,  reputation,  business,  prospects,  financial  condition,  and  results  of  operations.  Further,  these\nparticular risks may increase as market demand for our offerings grows.\n\nCertain of our suppliers also supply products and components to other businesses, including businesses engaged in the production of electric vehicles,\nrenewable  energy  production,  consumer  electronics  and  other  industries  unrelated  to  energy  storage  products.  As  a  relatively  low-volume  purchaser  of\ncertain of these products and components, we may be unable to procure a sufficient supply of these products and components on favorable terms, if at all. In\nthe event that our suppliers fail to produce sufficient quantities in a timely manner to satisfy the demands of all of their customers, including Fluence, it\ncould materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nInterruptions in the flow and/or availability of components and materials from international vendors could disrupt our supply chain and the imposition\nof additional duties or tariffs by government authorities, and other charges on imports and exports could affect our business and results of operations.\n\nOur products and services include many components and materials sourced from outside of the United States, resulting in exposure to international\nsupply chain risks and logistics disruptions. In the past, we have experienced delays in obtaining certain necessary components and materials from overseas,\nincluding as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trade and shipping disruptions and factors beyond our suppliers\u2019 control have in the past and we expect in\nthe future could have a compounding effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nInternational political, social, or economic instability, including as the result of future health pandemics similar to COVID-19, may lead to future trade\ndisruptions, impacting our supply chain and ability to complete projects in a timely and efficient manner. The uncertain actions, policies and legislative\nactions  of  various  government  authorities  on  international  and  domestic  trade,  including  new  or  increased  tariffs  or  quotas,  border  taxes,  embargoes,\nsafeguards, and customs restrictions impact our ability to manage our costs of production. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things)\nthe type of materials and components that may be impacted, the proposed rates imposed, and timing of such tariffs. Labor strikes, work stoppages and\nboycotts, similarly may have a negative impact on our total cost and ownership and result in reduced or delayed supply of materials and components, with\npotential adverse effects on our business and results of operations.\n\nDisruptions  in  the  availability  of  key  components  or  materials  and  their  associated  price  volatility  therefore  create  challenges  for  stability  of  our\n\nbusiness operations, customer relationships, and our ability to accurately plan for future growth.\n\nAdditionally,  there  are  increasing  expectations  in  various  jurisdictions  that  companies  monitor  the  environmental  and  social  performance  of  their\nsuppliers, including compliance with a variety of labor practices, as well as consider a wider range of potential environmental and social matters, including\nthe end of life considerations for products. For example, forced labor concerns have rapidly become a global area of interest, and is a topic that will likely be\nsubject to new regulations in the markets we operate within. Numerous laws imposes the prohibitive ban of the importation of goods made with forced labor\nor compulsory prison labor, including for example the Tariff Act of 1930, as well as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (\u201cUFLPA\u201d), and other global\nlaws against forced labor. Certain of our suppliers operate and source materials in China, and their presence in our supply chain could present unique risks\nfor us due to risks associated with the UFLPA, as well as the strain in U.S.-China relations, and China\u2019s unique regulatory landscape. The UFLPA imposes a\npresumptive ban on the importation of articles, merchandise, apparel, and goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur\nAutonomous Region (Xinjiang) of the People\u2019s Republic of China, or by entities identified by the U.S. government on the UFLPA Entity List. Forced labor\nconcerns have rapidly become a global area of interest, and is a topic that will likely be subject to further regulations or prohibitions in the markets we\noperate within.\n\nSuch a process could result in a delay or complete inability to import such materials (including potentially non-lithium materials), which could result in\ninventory shortages or greater supply chain compliance costs, particularly to the extent we need to identify new suppliers or to otherwise modify supply\nchains to address evolving regulatory requirements and/or interpretations. We could also be subject to penalties or fines if our imports are found to have\nbeen in violation of the UFLPA or other customs-related laws and regulations. Even if we are not subject to any fines or penalties, any perceived link\nbetween our products and Xinjiang, designated entities, or labor practices not in keeping with industry expectations may result in increased costs, affect our\nbusiness and damage our reputation. Overcoming the UFLPA\u2019s presumption can be a time- and information-intensive process, and we may not be able to\nobtain sufficient information to satisfy policymakers that products are not connected to forced labor. Moreover, Xinjiang is the source of significant amounts\nof raw and refined materials and components in the global lithium-ion battery supply chain, and there is ongoing\n\n18\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##scrutiny of this value chain and companies associated therewith, including for human rights and national security concerns. As such, there is a risk that our\noperations  may  be  impacted  by  related  supply  chain  disruptions  or  costs.  Moreover,  compliance  with  the  UFLPA  or  other  similar  current  or  proposed\nrequirements,  including  the  European  Union  Forced  Labor  Ban  Proposal,  may  have  other  effects  on  the  global  supply  chain,  the  price  and  scarcity  of\ntraceable minerals or other materials of focus, and could lead to increases in our cost of goods sold, which could have an adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\n\nOther events that could disrupt our supply chain include:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nthe imposition of additional trade legislation or regulations both internationally and domestically;\n\nthe imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges on imports and exports, including as a result of the ongoing trade war between the\nUnited States and China;\ndisruption  of  manufacturing  and  supply  lines  due  to  stringent  government  mandated  sanctions  on  production  continuity  and  the  movement  of\ngoods;\n\nbreach of supply contracts by suppliers and vendors;\n\ntheft;\n\nnatural disasters;\n\nlogistics and shipping constraints;\n\nquotas imposed by bilateral trade agreements;\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\npublic health issues and epidemic diseases, their effects (including any disruptions they may cause) and/or the perception of their effects;\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nWe cannot predict whether the countries in which our components and materials are sourced, or may be sourced in the future, will be subject to new or\nadditional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, effect, or magnitude of any such\nrestrictions and their overall impact on our business and our operating results.\nSignificant  changes  in  the  cost  and/or  availability  of  raw  materials  and  components  that  are  incorporated  into  our  energy  storage  products  could\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, and future prospects.\n\nthe financial instability or bankruptcy of vendors; and\n\nsignificant labor disputes, such as dock strikes.\n\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\nWe are subject to risk from availability and fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, including, but not limited to, steel, aluminum,\ncopper, nickel, iron phosphate, graphite, manganese, lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, and cobalt. These raw materials form an essential and integral\npart of our energy storage products. Prices and availability of these raw materials is oftentimes affected by, amongst other things, global supply and demand\nimbalance, inventory levels, changes in interest rates, speculative market activities, and geopolitical uncertainty. During fiscal year 2022, there was sizable\nincreases in the cost of certain metals, including lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, which led to an increase in the price of lithium-ion batteries,\nhowever,  prices  decreased  again  in  fiscal  year  2023.  Our  revenue  growth  is  directly  tied  to  the  continued  adoption  of  energy  storage  products  by  our\ncustomers, which may be affected by commodity raw material price fluctuations and component price fluctuations. As we have not historically been the\nbuyer of raw materials for our components and energy storage products, we have not historically entered into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity\nrisk. Significant price changes or reduced availability for our raw materials and components has a deleterious effect on supply chain certainty with potential\nknock on effects for reduced operating margin, and in turn, could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nFailure  by  our  vendors  and  suppliers  to  use  ethical  business  practices  and  comply  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  including  labor  and\nenvironmental laws, may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe  do  not  control  our  vendors  or  suppliers  nor  their  business  practices.  Accordingly,  we  cannot  guarantee  that  they  follow  ethical  employment\npractices, such as with respect to child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, safe and healthy working conditions, and with all legal and\nregulatory requirements relating to the conduct of their businesses. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative manufacturers or\nsuppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages, or other disruptions of our operations. Violation\nof labor (including forced labor and child labor) or\n\n19\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##other laws by our manufacturers or suppliers or the divergence of a supplier\u2019s labor or other work practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the\nU.S. or other markets in which we do business could result in fines for the Company, as well as attract negative publicity for us and otherwise adversely\nharm our business. Violation of laws by our manufacturers or suppliers could also subject us to regulatory consequences as well. For more information, see\nour risk factor titled \u201cInterruptions in the flow and/or availability of components and materials from international vendors could disrupt our supply chain and\nthe imposition of additional duties or tariffs by government authorities, and other charges on imports and exports could affect our business and results of\noperations.\u201d\nA loss of one or more of our significant customers, including but not limited to AES and Siemens, and the inability of customers to perform under their\nrespective contracts could harm our business and negatively impact revenue, results of operations, and cash flow.\n\nWe are dependent on a relatively small number of customers for our sales, and a small number of customers have historically accounted for a material\nportion of our revenue. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, our two largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 49% of our\nannual  revenue.  The  loss  of  any  one  of  the  Company\u2019s  significant  customers,  their  inability  to  perform  under  their  contracts,  including  their  default  in\npayment, a significant dispute with one of these customers, a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of any of these\ncustomers, or any other event significantly negatively impacting the contractual relationship with one of these customers could have a materially adverse\neffect on the revenues and cash flows of the Company. For the near future, we may continue to derive a significant portion of our net sales from a small\nnumber of customers. Accordingly, loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in pricing or order volume from a significant customer  could\nmaterially reduce net sales and operating results in any reporting period.\n\nWe  face  increasing  competition  for  our  energy  storage  product,  service,  and  digital  application  offerings  from  both  more  established  and  new\ncompetitors, and if we are unable to attract new customers and retain existing customers, our revenue growth and operating results may be adversely\naffected.\n\nWe operate in an increasingly competitive business environment for our energy storage product, service, and digital application offerings. To increase\nour  revenue  and  market  share,  our  business  strategy  depends  on  our  ability  to  attract  new  customers  and  retain  our  existing  customers.  Certain  of  our\ncompetitors have financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, and other resources that are greater than ours, which may allow them to devote greater\nresources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their product, service, and digital application offerings\nthan we may be able to and therefore more effectively compete for new projects and customers. We expect competition in the energy storage industry to\nincrease  due  to  increased  demand  from  customers  and  recent  regulatory  changes  and  incentives  geared  towards  adoption  of  energy  storage  solutions,\nservices, and digital applications, including as a result of the IRA and its anticipated impacts in the United States.\n\nConsolidation  by  other  industry  participants  could  further  increase  their  resources  and  result  in  competitors  with  expanded  market  share,  larger\ncustomer bases, greater diversified product and service offerings and greater technological and marketing expertise, which may allow them to compete more\neffectively against us in the future. Moreover, our competitors may have or may develop products, services, or digital applications that are superior to our\nproducts, services, or digital applications (on a price-to-value basis or otherwise) or may adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or regulatory\nregimes  implemented  across  the  globe.  There  are  also  several  competing  alternatives  for  energy  storage  solutions,  as  well  as  non-intermittent  energy\ngeneration that does not require storage,including but not limited to: lithium-ion batteries, other batteries, pumped hydro, hydrogen, biofuels, and generation\npaired  with  carbon  sequestration.  If  we  are  unable  to  convince  potential  customers  of  the  benefits  of  our  products,  services,  and  digital  applications,\neffectively differentiate our product, service, and digital application offerings from our competitors, or if potential or existing customers prefer the offerings\nof our competitors, we may not be able to effectively implement this aspect of our growth strategy, which may adversely impact our business. Additionally,\na significant portion of our annual sales in fiscal year 2023 and 2022 were direct sales to AES or a result of our Siemens sales relationship. If we fail to\nmaintain those relationships with AES and Siemens or if those relationships weaken, or if AES or Siemens decide to reduce their energy storage activities, it\ncould materially impact our business prospects, financial condition, cash flows or sales. Our future growth would then be even more reliant on our ability to\nrecruit and retain new customers outside of AES and Siemens and our existing relationships with them. Our inability to recruit new customers and retain\nexisting customers would harm our ability to execute our growth strategy and may have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial\nposition.\n\nIf we fail to effectively manage our recent and future growth and expansion of our business and operations, we may be unable to execute our business\nplan, maintain high levels of customer service, and/or adequately address competitive challenges.\n\nWe have experienced significant and rapid growth in recent periods. We intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new\nmarket  segments.  This  growth  has  placed,  and  any  future  growth  may  place,  a  significant  strain  on  our  management,  operational,  and  financial\ninfrastructure. In the continued growth and expansion of the Company, our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with\ncustomers, suppliers, channel partners, and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers, as well as manage multiple geographic locations. To\nmanage our growth, we must continue to\n\n20\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##improve  and  expand  our  IT  and  financial  infrastructure  and  systems,  our  operating  and  administrative  systems  and  controls,  our  ability  to  manage\nheadcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. Our current and planned future infrastructure, plans and processes might be inadequate to support\nour future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investment and improvements, which may adversely impact our financial condition\nand may disrupt our operations and business. Our success and ability to further scale our business will depend, in part, on our ability to manage expansion\nand growth in a cost-effective and efficient manner. If we cannot manage our growth, we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities, execute\nour business strategies, or respond appropriately and quickly to competitive pressures. This could also result in declines in product quality and customer\nsatisfaction, reputational damage, increased costs, difficulties in introducing new offerings, reduce demand for our offerings, or other operational difficulties.\nOur  future  operating  results  depend  on  a  large  extent  on  our  ability  to  manage  our  continued  expansion  and  growth  successfully  and  any  failure  to\neffectively manage expansion and growth could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn an increasingly competitive market, enhancing our reputation and brand recognition is critical for maintaining our position as an industry leader. If\nwe are not able to maintain and strengthen our reputation and brand recognition, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\n\nWe  anticipate  that,  as  the  markets  for  energy  storage  and  SaaS  products  for  renewables  and  storage  become  increasingly  competitive,  marketing\ninitiatives may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Our marketing activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue and may fail to yield\nincreased revenue, the increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur as part of any marketing initiatives, and our results of operations could be\nharmed. Our ability to maintain and strengthen Fluence brand will depend heavily on our ability to provide quality offerings to our customers. In order to\nprotect our brand, we may also expend substantial resources to register our intellectual property rights and to prevent others from using similar intellectual\nproperty,  including  similar  patents  and  trademarks.  Any  factor  that  diminishes  our  reputation  or  that  of  our  management,  including  failing  to  meet  the\nexpectations of or provide quality products and services to our customers on a timely basis, or any adverse publicity or litigation, could make it substantially\nmore difficult for us to attract new customers and to maintain our existing customers. Our ability to successfully position our brand could also be adversely\naffected by perceptions of our competitors\u2019 products, services, and digital applications. If we do not successfully maintain and strengthen our reputation and\nbrand  recognition,  our  business  may  not  grow,  and  we  could  lose  our  relationships  with  existing  customers.  This  would  harm  our  business,  results  of\noperations, and financial condition.\n\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties.\n\nWe rely on third-party general contractors to install energy storage products at our customers\u2019 sites. We currently work with a limited number of general\ncontractors, which has impacted and may continue to impact our ability to facilitate customer installations as planned in a timely and efficient manner. Our\nwork with contractors or their subcontractors may result in us being required to comply with additional rules (including rules unique to our customers),\nworking conditions, site remediation, and other union requirements, which can add costs and complexity to a project. The timeliness, thoroughness, and\nquality  of  the  installation-related  services  performed  by  our  general  contractors  and  their  subcontractors  in  the  past  have  not  always  met  our  or  our\ncustomers\u2019 expectations or standards and in the future may not meet our or our customers\u2019 expectations and standards, and it may be difficult to find and\ntrain third-party general contractors that meet our standards at a competitive cost.\n\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, including members of the senior management team, in order to execute our business strategy\nand growth plan, our business and ability to compete may be adversely affected.\n\nCompetition  for  highly  qualified  personnel  is  intense  in  our  industry  across  geographic  areas.  We  depend  on  the  continued  services  of  our  senior\nmanagement and highly-skilled employees across all levels and departments of our organization to run and grow our business. We have experienced, and we\nexpect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. The challenging markets in which we compete\nfor talent may also require us to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain employees. In addition, a significant portion of our\ncompensation to our key employees is in the form of stock related grants. A prolonged depression in our stock price could make it difficult for us to retain\nour  key  members  of  management  and  other  employees  and  recruit  additional  qualified  personnel  and  we  may  have  to  pay  additional  compensation  to\nemployees to incentivize them to join or stay with us. Further, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater\nfinancial  resources  than  we  have.  If  we  hire  employees  from  competitors  or  other  companies,  their  former  employers  may  attempt  to  assert  that  these\nemployees or the Company has breached certain legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources.\n\nWe have adopted a hybrid work policy for our employees in the United States, where employees are expected to split time between home and the office.\nMany companies, including companies that we compete with for talent, have announced plans to adopt full time remote work arrangements or hybrid work\narrangements more flexible than ours, which may impact our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel if potential or current employees prefer these\npolicies. In addition, as a result of our recent move to a hybrid work environment, we expect to face challenges in retention of personnel who prefer to only\nwork from home. We have and may continue to face turnover resulting from the hybrid work policy, requiring us to expend time and resources to source,\ntrain  and  integrate  new  employees.  In  addition,  current  trends  in  the  labor  market  (including  elevated  employee  attrition,  labor  availability  and  wage\ninflation) have exacerbated and may continue to exacerbate the challenges of attracting and retaining talented and diverse\n\n21\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##employees. Differences in demands, expectations and priorities of the workforce (such as remote work expectations) may require us to modify our recruiting\nand retention strategies to attract and retain employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business\nand future growth prospects and ability to compete could be adversely impacted.\n\nMoreover,  our  success  depends  largely  upon  the  continued  services  and  leadership  of  our  senior  management  team.  Our  senior  management  has\nacquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our business, and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business. From time to time,\nthere may be changes in our senior management team, including as a result from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. Our\nofficers are not subject to any restrictions that would require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate\ntheir employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of the members of our senior management team, could harm our business.\n\nWe have experienced and may continue to be exposed to risks associated with construction, utility interconnection, commissioning and installation of\nour products, cost overruns from increased shipping and logistics prices as well as increased prices on raw materials necessary for the production of\nlithium-ion batteries, and delays, including those related to obtaining government authorizations and permits and other contingencies that may arise in\nthe course of completing installations.\n\nAlthough we generally are not regulated as a utility, federal, state, and local government laws and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence\nthe market for our products and services. These laws and regulations often relate to electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, and the rules\nsurrounding  the  interconnection  of  customer-owned  electricity  generation  for  specific  technologies.  In  the  U.S.,  governments  frequently  modify  these\nstatutes and regulations. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different requirements for utilities\nand rates for commercial customers on a regular basis. Changes, or in some cases a lack of change, in any of the laws, regulations, ordinances, or other rules\nthat apply to customer installations and new technology could make it more costly for our customers to install and operate our energy storage products on\nparticular projects sites, and in turn, could negatively affect our ability to deliver cost savings to customers for the purchase of electricity, thereby making\nour energy storage products less appealing to current customers and potential customers.\n\nThe installation and operation of our energy storage products at a particular site are also generally subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with\nfederal,  state,  and  local  laws  and  ordinances  relating  to  building  codes,  safety,  environmental  protection,  and  related  matters.  It  also  typically  requires\nobtaining and keeping in good standing various local and other governmental approvals and permits, including environmental approvals and permits, that\nvary  by  jurisdiction.  In  some  cases,  these  approvals  and  permits  require  periodic  renewal.  It  is  difficult  and  costly  to  track  the  requirements  of  every\nindividual authority having jurisdiction over our energy storage product installations, to design our energy storage products to comply with these varying\nstandards, and for our customers to obtain and maintain all applicable necessary approvals and permits. We cannot predict whether or when all permits\nrequired for a given customer\u2019s project will be granted or whether the conditions associated with the permits will be achievable. The denial of a permit or\nutility connection essential to a project or the imposition of impractical conditions would impair our customer\u2019s ability to develop the project, and potential\ndisagreement or litigation over a project approval could lead to additional delays. In addition, we cannot predict whether the permitting process will be\nlengthened due to complexities and appeals. Delay in the review and permitting process for a project (or litigation challenges to a project approval) can\nimpair or delay our customers\u2019 abilities to develop that project or increase the cost so substantially that the project is no longer attractive to our customers.\nFurthermore, unforeseen delays in the review and permitting process could delay the timing of the installation of our energy storage products and could\ntherefore  adversely  affect  the  amount  revenue  recognition  related  to  the  sale  of  our  energy  storage  products,  which  could  in  turn  adversely  affect  our\noperating results. Delays in the review and permitting process have in the past and may in the future lead to cost overruns, which may have further adverse\neffects on our business and operating results.\n\nThe production and installation of our energy storage products also involves the incurrence of various project costs and can entail project modifications.\nWe have policies and procedures regarding approval of project costs and modifications. In connection with our limited operating history and our significant\ngrowth, we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience incurrence of project costs in excess of those budgeted. In addition, disagreements\nwith our customers and suppliers have arisen and may in the future arise with respect to project schedules, work, and modifications, which can result in the\nneed to find different suppliers, loss of future business, additional costs to us and not fully realizing the anticipated profit from the project.\n\nIn addition, the successful installation of our energy storage products and solutions is dependent upon the availability of and timely connection to the\nlocal  electric  grid.  Our  customers  may  be  unable  to  timely  obtain  the  required  consent  and  authorization  of  local  utilities  to  ensure  successful\ninterconnection  to  energy  grids  to  enable  the  successful  discharge  of  renewable  energy,  if  at  all.  Any  delays  in  our  customers\u2019  ability  to  connect  with\nutilities, delays in the performance of installation-related services, or poor performance of installation-related services will have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness and results of operations and could cause our results to vary materially from period to period.\n\nOur products, including components thereof, and technology could have undetected defects, errors, vulnerabilities, and/or bugs in hardware or software\nwhich  could  reduce  market  adoption,  cause  reputational  damage  and/or  expose  us  to  legal  claims  that  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our\nbusiness.\n\n22\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##The energy storage products and solutions we develop are complex and have in the past and may in the future contain bugs, vulnerabilities, design and\nmanufacturing-related defects and errors. We have not historically manufactured batteries or other components of our energy storage products and solutions\nand relied on our component OEM suppliers and contract manufacturers to control the quality of such components, however we anticipate that we will begin\nproduction of the Fluence-made battery packs in mid-2024, which will include battery modules and a battery management system although we will continue\nto source battery modules and battery management systems from other suppliers as well. We provide installation, construction and commissioning services\nfor our customers that purchase our products. In the past, we have from time to time discovered latent defects in energy storage products and solutions and\nthe components thereof and have experienced defects in workmanship and in the future we may face similar such defects. We have implemented various\nquality and control initiatives and processes to help prevent defects and issues, which we continue to work on and improve continuously, however, there is\nno  absolute  guarantee  that  there  will  not  be  a  latent  defect  in  a  component  from  a  supplier  or  manufacturer  or  from  a  component  we  ourselves  have\nmanufactured. Defects may occur in the future which may result in significant expenses or disruptions of our operations. We are continuing to evolve the\nfeatures  and  functionality  of  our  products  and  technology  platform  through  updates  and  enhancements,  and  as  we  do,  we  may  introduce  inadvertent\nadditional defects or errors that may not be detected until after deployment to customers through our hardware. Any attempt to remedy issues we observe in\nour hardware and software effectively and efficiently may not be timely and may not be to the satisfaction of our customers. If we are unable to prevent or\neffectively  remedy  errors,  bugs,  vulnerabilities  or  defects  in  our  software  and  hardware,  or  fail  to  deploy  updates  to  our  software  properly,  we  could\npotentially suffer reputational damage, increased costs, and potential impact to our customer relationships, any of which could adversely affect our business,\nprospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nSince we do not manufacture certain components of our energy storage products, our ability to seek recourse for liabilities and recover costs from our\ncomponent OEM suppliers and contract manufacturers depends on our contractual rights as well as the financial condition and integrity of such component\nOEM  suppliers  and  contract  manufacturers.  Furthermore,  our  component  OEM  suppliers  and  contract  manufacturers  may  be  unable  or  not  required  to\ncorrect manufacturing defects or other failures of such components of our energy storage products in a manner satisfactory to our customers, which could\nadversely  affect  customer  satisfaction,  market  acceptance,  and  our  business  reputation.  On  rare  occasions,  lithium-ion  batteries  can  rapidly  release  the\nenergy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion batteries. This faulty result could\nsubject us to lawsuits, product recalls, or redesign efforts, all of which would be time consuming and expensive. For example, in April 2019, the McMicken\nenergy  storage  facility  in  Arizona  experienced  a  thermal  event  and  subsequent  explosion,  injuring  several  first  responders  and  making  the  facility\ninoperable.  The  facility  was  built  prior  to  the  creation  of  Fluence  and  was  under  a  maintenance  contract  with  Fluence.  The  response  and  investigation\nrequired significant expense and the devotion of significant management time. Also, general negative public perception regarding the suitability of lithium-\nion batteries for energy applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion batteries, such as a plant, vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does\nnot involve Fluence, could adversely affect our business and reputation.\n\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other legal claims against\nus. Any insurance that we carry may not be sufficient or it may not apply to all situations. In addition, our customers could be subjected to claims as a result\nof such incidents and may bring legal claims against us to attempt to hold us liable. Any of these events could adversely affect our brand and reputation,\nrelationships with customers, operating results, or financial condition. For example, on September 4, 2021, a 300 MW energy storage facility owned by one\nof our customers experienced an overheating event and the customer\u2019s stated findings, if ultimately confirmed and proven, could relate to certain scopes of\nwork for which Fluence or its subcontractors could be responsible. The customer\u2019s stated findings, however, could also relate to certain scopes of work for\nwhich other parties were responsible and/or relate to other causes, including the design and installation of portions of the facility over which Fluence did not\nhave responsibility or control. The customer has alleged that Fluence is liable for the incident but has not yet demanded a specific amount of compensation\nnor alleged a particular level of responsibility. Fluence has denied liability and cannot comment on the customer\u2019s findings at this time. No formal legal\nproceedings have been commenced, but it is reasonably possible that litigation may result from this matter if a resolution cannot be achieved. To date, we do\nnot believe that this incident has impacted the market\u2019s adoption of our products.\n\nIn addition, Fluence Mosaic generates artificial intelligence-enabled bid recommendations for utility-scale storage and renewable generation assets,\nenabling customers to optimize asset trading in wholesale electricity markets. While we are generally not regulated as a utility or a broker-dealer, customers\nof  Fluence  Mosaic  are  regulated  market  participants.  We  could  experience  scrutiny  from  regulators  on  the  provision  of  Fluence  Mosaic  bid\nrecommendations to our customers and use of such application and the related technologies by our customers. Fluence Nispera, which optimizes renewable\nasset performance with real-time monitoring, automated reporting, and AI-powered analytics, integrates asset data with intelligent machine learning models\nand visualization tools. Both of these digital applications could experience a software anomaly, that could result in an unexpected, material adverse event for\ncustomers, and may therefore damage our reputation, business and future prospects.\n\nAny defects or errors in our product, service, or digital applications offerings, or the perception of such defects or errors, or other performance problems\n\ncould result in any of the following, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations:\n\n23\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##\u2022\n\nexpenditure of significant financial and product development resources, including recalls, in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around\nerrors or defects;\n\nsales credits or refunds;\n\ndelayed or lost revenue;\n\ninterruptions or delays in sales;\n\nsignificant re-engineering costs;\n\nnegative publicity and reputational harm;\n\ndelay or failure to attain market acceptance;\n\nloss of existing or potential customers or partners;\n\ndelay in the development or release of new functionality or improvements;\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nAlthough  we  have  contractual  protections,  including  warranty  disclaimers  and  limitation  of  liability  provisions,  in  many  of  our  agreements  with\ncustomers, resellers, and other business partners, such protections may not be uniformly implemented in all contracts and, where implemented, may not\nfully  or  effectively  protect  from  claims  by  customers,  resellers,  business  partners  or  other  third  parties.  Any  insurance  coverage  or  indemnification\nobligations of suppliers may not adequately cover all such claims or cover only a portion of such claims. A successful product liability, warranty, or other\nsimilar  claim  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  operating  results.  In  addition,  even  claims  that  ultimately  are\nunsuccessful could result in expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management\u2019s time and other resources, and cause reputational harm as well as lead to\npotential loss of existing or future customers. .\n\nsecurity vulnerabilities, data breaches, and exposure of confidential or proprietary information;\n\nlegal claims and regulatory actions under applicable laws, rules, and regulations; and\n\ndiversion of development and customer service resources;\n\nthe expense and risk of litigation.\n\nbreach of warranty claims;\n\nCompromises, interruptions, or shutdowns of our systems, including those managed by third parties, whether intentional or inadvertent, could lead to\ndelays in our business operations and, if significant or extreme, affect our results of operations.\n\nFrom  time  to  time,  our  systems  require  modifications  and  updates,  including  by  adding  new  hardware,  software,  and  applications;  maintaining,\nupdating, or replacing legacy programs; and integrating new service providers and adding enhanced or new functionality. Although we are actively selecting\nsystems and vendors and implementing procedures to enable us to maintain the integrity of our systems when we modify them, there are inherent risks\nassociated with modifying or replacing systems, and with new or changed relationships, including accurately capturing and maintaining data, realizing the\nexpected benefit of the change, and managing the potential disruption of the operation of the systems as the changes are implemented. Potential issues\nassociated with implementation of these technology initiatives could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. The efficient operation and\nsuccessful growth of our business depends upon our information technology systems. The failure of our information technology systems and the third-party\nsystems we rely on to perform as designed, or our failure to implement and operate them effectively, could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and\nthereby may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nOur energy storage products, which are complex, could contain defects, and/ or may not operate at expected performance levels, which may cause us to\nincur warranty expenses beyond current estimates and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nWe  offer  standard  limited  assurance  type  product  warranties,  as  well  as  extended  service  type  warranties.  Our  limited  warranties  cover  defects  in\nmaterials and workmanship of our products for normal use and service conditions typically between one and five years following commercial operation date\nor substantial completion depending on the contract. As a result, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold the product and recognized\nrevenue.  Our  estimated  costs  of  warranty  for  previously  sold  products  may  change  to  the  extent  future  products  may  not  be  compatible  with  earlier\ngeneration products under warranty. Furthermore, as we are in a evolving industry, there is a degree of uncertainty regarding estimated warranty costs due to\nlimited data.\n\n24\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##We have limited operating history and therefore must project how our product will perform over the estimated warranty period and the estimated reserve\nmay have material changes. In addition, under real world operating conditions, which may vary by location and design, as well as environmental conditions,\nour product may perform in a different way than under standard test conditions or other failure data sets. We depend significantly on our reputation for\nreliability and high-quality products and services, exceptional customer service and our brand name to attract new customers and grow our business. If our\nproducts and services do not perform as anticipated or we experience unexpected reliability problems or widespread product failures, our brand and market\nreputation  could  be  significantly  impaired  and  we  may  lose,  or  be  unable  to  gain  or  retain,  customers  which  could  impact  our  business  and  results  of\noperations.\n\nBecause of the limited operating history of our products, we have been required to make assumptions and apply judgments, including the durability and\nreliability of our products, performance over the estimated warranty period and our anticipated rate of warranty claims. Our assumptions could prove to be\nmaterially different from the actual performance of our products, causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products in the future.\nAn increase in our estimates of future warranty obligations due to product failure rates, field service obligations and rework costs incurred in correcting\nproduct  failures  could  cause  us  to  increase  the  amount  of  warranty  obligations  and  may  adversely  impact  on  our  results  of  operations.  If  our  warranty\nreserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our energy storage products, our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely\naffected. Warranty reserves include our management\u2019s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which is based on\nestimated  failure  rates.  Such  estimates  are  inherently  uncertain  and  changes  to  our  historical  or  projected  experience,  especially  with  respect  to  energy\nstorage products which are still in development and which we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material\nchanges to our warranty reserves in the future.\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our operating results.\n\nThe Company in the ordinary course of business enters into projects globally, which are denominated in foreign currencies such as the Euro, the Pound,\nthe Australian Dollar, and the Canadian Dollar, and is therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In particular,\ncurrent geopolitical instability and fiscal and monetary policies have caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in the currency exchange rates,\nand such volatility may continue for the foreseeable future. If our exposure to currency fluctuations increases and we are not able to successfully hedge\nagainst all the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our operating results could be adversely affected. Furthermore, such currency fluctuations may\nalso adversely impact our ability to accurately predict our future financial results. Therefore, from time to time, we seek to manage our exposure to foreign\ncurrency  risk  relating  to  these  cash  flow  projects  through  entering  into  different  types  of  hedging  arrangements  designed  to  reduce  such  risk  exposure.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will successfully reduce our risk exposure. In addition, there may be unforeseen events\naffecting our business that could lead us to be long in positions that we did not anticipate when such hedging transactions were put into place which in turn\ncould lead to adverse effects on our financial position.\n\nOur current and planned foreign operations expose us to additional business, financial, regulatory, geopolitical, and other related risks which may have\na material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe sell our products and solutions and have operations in a number of different countries, including, but not limited to, the United States, the United\nKingdom, multiple European Union countries, Chile, Australia, Taiwan, India, Canada, and the Philippines. We have in the past, and may in the future,\nevaluate and take advantage of opportunities to expand into new geographic markets and introduce new offerings that are a natural extension of our existing\nbusiness. We also may from time to time engage in acquisitions of businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our market position, enable us\nto enter attractive markets, expand our technological capabilities, or provide synergy opportunities in those geographic markets we currently are in or in\nother geographic markets that we have not yet penetrated.\n\nOperating globally requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to business, financial, regulatory, geopolitical, and other\nrelated risks. In particular, our international operations and the markets in which we operate or that we may operate in in the future expose us to risks,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\ncompliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing laws, regulations and permitting processes, including trade, labor, environmental,\nhealth, safety, banking, employment, privacy and data protection and privacy laws and regulations, such as the EU Data Privacy Directive, as well\nas tariffs, export quotas, customs duties and other trade restrictions;\n\ncompliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended;\n\ncompliance with potentially conflicting and changing laws of taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business and applicable U.S. tax laws as they\nrelate  to  international  operations,  the  complexity  and  adverse  consequences  of  such  tax  laws  and  potentially  adverse  tax  consequences  due  to\nchanges in such tax laws;\nlimited or unfavorable intellectual property protection and practical difficulties associated with enforcing our legal rights abroad;\n\n25\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\ngeopolitical or economic conditions or uncertainty, which may include war, political instability or unrest, or terrorism, and natural disasters and\npandemics;\nincreased management, travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with having operations in many countries;\n\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships, including political risk and customer perceptions based on such changes and risks;\nheightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies that may impact our financial results and result in restatements of our\nconsolidated financial statements;\n\n restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\ndifferent customer and sales practices including longer sales cycles, warranty expectations, and product return policies;\ndiffering technical standards, existing or future regulatory and certification requirements, and required features and functionality as well as different\ncost, performance, and compatibility requirements; and\n\nfluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and global inflation.\n\nThese risks listed above are generally beyond our ability to adequately control, influence or predict and if we fail to successfully control, influence, or\n\npredict these risks, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur hardware and software-enabled services involve a lengthy sales and installation cycle, and if we fail to close sales on a regular and timely basis it\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nOur current sales and installation cycle averages up to twenty months for our hardware and software-enabled services but varies considerably on a\nproject by project basis. In order to make a sale, we must often provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and\nbenefits of our hardware and software-enabled services. The period between initial discussions with a potential customer and the sale of an energy storage\nproduct typically depends on a number of factors, including the potential customer\u2019s budget and decision as to the type of financing it chooses to use, as well\nas the arrangement of such financing. Prospective customers often undertake a significant internal evaluation process, which may further extend the sales\ncycle. Because of the long sales cycle, we may expend significant resources without having certainty of generating a sale. This lengthy sales cycle is subject\nto a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control.\n\nThese lengthy sales and installation cycles increase the risk that our customers may fail to satisfy their payment obligations, increased labor costs for\ntrouble shooting and commissioning, increased financing costs, that our customers may cancel orders before the completion of the transaction, or delay the\nplanned date for installation. Cancellation rates may be impacted by factors outside of our control including an inability to timely install an energy storage\nproduct at the customer\u2019s chosen location, if at all, because of permitting or other regulatory issues, unanticipated changes in the cost or availability of\nalternative sources of electricity available to the customer, or other reasons unique to each customer. If we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending\nsignificant resources or if we experience delays or cancellations in the installation process, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\n\nAmounts included in our pipeline and contracted backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits.\n\nInformation about our pipeline and contracted backlog included in this Annual Report is based on numerous assumptions and limitations, calculated\nusing our internal data which may not provide an accurate indication of our future or expected results as we cannot guarantee that our pipeline or contracted\nbacklog will result in actual revenue in the originally anticipated period, if at all, or will result in meaningful revenue or profitability. Our customers operate\nin a relatively new industry and have based their commitments to us on assumptions about future energy prices, demand levels, regulatory regimes and\nincentives, among other factors. Further, certain customers may need to obtain financing to fulfill their commitments to us. If the market does not grow as\nexpected, the regulatory environment changes, or customers fail to obtain necessary financial backing, customers may fail to satisfy their minimum purchase\ncommitments to us and we would fail to realize our contracted backlog. Furthermore, our pipeline or contracted backlog may not generate margins equal to\nhistorical operating results or to the expected level guided to by management. We have only tracked our pipeline and contracted backlog on a consistent\nbasis for a relatively short period of time, and as a result, we do not have significant experience in determining the level of realization that we will achieve\non these contracts. Our customers may experience delays that could result in project delays or cancelled orders as a result of external market factors and\neconomic or other factors beyond our control. If our pipeline or contracted backlog fails to result in revenue as anticipated or in a timely manner, we could\nexperience a reduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\n\n26\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Key Operating Metrics\u201d for additional information regarding our pipeline and contracted backlog.\n\nIf our estimates of useful life for our energy storage products and related hardware and software-enabled services are inaccurate or if our component\nOEM suppliers do not meet service and performance warranties and guarantees, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\n\nWe sell hardware products and software-enabled services to our customers. Our software-enabled services are essential to the operation of our hardware\nproducts. Our pricing of services contracts is based upon the value we expect to deliver to our customers, including considerations such as the useful life of\nthe energy storage product and prevailing electricity prices. We also provide warranties and guarantees covering the efficiency and performance of certain of\nour products and digital applications. We do not have a long history with a large number of field deployments, and our estimates may prove to be incorrect.\nFailure to meet these performance warranties and guarantee levels may require us to refund our service contract payments to the customer or require us to\nmake cash payments to the customer based on actual performance, as compared to expected performance, or may result in litigation by customers, which\nwould impact our brand, business, and results of operations.\n\nAs part of growing our business, we have in the past made acquisitions and expect to continue to evaluate acquisitions into the future. If we fail to\nsuccessfully select, execute, or integrate our acquisitions, then our business and operating results could be adversely affected and our stock price could\ndecline.\n\nWe continuously evaluate potential acquisitions to add new product lines and technologies, gain new sales channels, enter into new sales territories, or\nexpand our market share. For example, in 2022, we acquired our asset performance management software, Fluence Nispera, and in 2020, we acquired a\nsoftware and digital intelligence platform, which has become Fluence Mosaic. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including but not limited\nto the following:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nintegrating the companies, assets, systems, products, sales channels, and personnel that we acquire;\n\nhigher than anticipated acquisition and integration costs and expenses;\n\nreliance on third parties to provide transition services for a period of time after closing to ensure an orderly transition of the business;\n\ngrowing or maintaining revenues to justify the purchase price and the increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\nentering into territories or markets with which we have limited or no prior experience;\n\nestablishing or maintaining business relationships with customers, vendors, and suppliers who may be new to us;\n\novercoming the employee, customer, vendor, and supplier turnover that may occur as a result of the acquisition;\n\ndisruption of, and demands on, our ongoing business as a result of integration activities including diversion of management\u2019s time and attention\nfrom running the day to day operations of our business;\n\nunfavorable tax or accounting treatment;\n\ninability to implement uniform standards, disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls over financial reporting, and other procedures and\npolicies in a timely manner, if at all;\n\ninability to realize the anticipated benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses, products, technologies or personnel\nthat we acquire;\nfailure to appropriately and holistically identify all the problems, liabilities, risks, or other challenges of any acquisition, technology or solution at\nthe time of closing;\n\nknown and unknown liabilities including contract, tax, regulatory or other legal, and other obligations incurred by the acquired business or fines or\npenalties, for which indemnity obligations, escrow arrangements or insurance may not be available or may not be sufficient to provide coverage;\nand\n\npotential post-closing disputes.\n\n\u2022\nAs part of undertaking an acquisition, we may also significantly revise our capital structure or operational budget, including through issuing common\n\nstock that would dilute the ownership percentage of our stockholders, assuming liabilities or debt, utilizing a\n\n27\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##substantial portion of our cash resources to pay for the acquisition, or significantly increasing operating expenses. In addition, our effective tax rate in any\nparticular  quarter  may  also  be  impacted  by  acquisitions.  Following  the  closing  of  an  acquisition,  we  may  also  have  disputes  with  the  seller  regarding\ncontractual  requirements  and  covenants,  purchase  price  adjustments,  contingent  payments,  or  indemnifiable  losses.  Any  such  disputes  may  be  time\nconsuming and distract management from other aspects of our business. In addition, if we increase the pace or size of acquisitions, we will have to expend\nsignificant  management  time  and  effort  into  the  transactions  and  integrations,  and  we  may  not  have  the  proper  human  resources  bandwidth  to  ensure\nsuccessful integrations and accordingly, our business could be harmed or the benefits of our acquisitions may not be realized.\n\nOur  customer  relationships,  business,  financial  results  and  reputation  may  be  adversely  impacted  due  to  events  and  incidents  relating  to  storage,\ndelivery, installation, operation, maintenance, and shutdowns of our energy storage products.\n\nOur  customer  relationships,  business,  financial  results,  and  reputation  may  be  adversely  impacted  due  to  events  and  incidents  relating  to  storage,\ndelivery,  installation,  operation  and  shutdowns  of  our  energy  storage  products,  including  events  and  incidents  outside  of  our  control.  We  are  subject  to\nvarious risks as a result of the size, weight, and sophisticated nature of our energy storage products, including exposure to production, delivery, supply\nchain, inventory, installation and maintenance issues. Such issues may, and from time to time have, result in financial losses, including losses resulting from\nour failure to deliver or install our energy storage products on a contractually agreed timeframe, or losses resulting from agreed warranty or indemnity\nterms.  Furthermore,  issues  and  incidents  involving  our  customers  or  their  facilities  at  which  our  energy  storage  products  are  located,  whether  or  not\nattributable to our energy storage products, may have an adverse effect on our reputation and customer relationships. Any of these developments could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nActual or threatened health epidemics, pandemics or similar public health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had and could in the future\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, outlook, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n\nThe global markets in which we operate were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and could in the future be adversely affected by COVID-19 or\nother health pandemics, epidemics or similar public health threats. For example, in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our\nground operations at project sites, our manufacturing facilities and our suppliers and vendors were disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines, shortage\nof COVID-19 test kits and personal protection equipment for employees, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure,\nand other travel and health-related restrictions. Additionally, we saw COVID-19 driven lockdowns in key areas for our battery suppliers, such as China, that\nresulted in our battery suppliers issuing delay notices to us. Due to the delays from our battery suppliers, some of our intended projects were delayed,\nresulting in lower revenue recognition. Additionally, some of our projects that were delayed because of COVID-19 supply chain disruptions also incurred\nliquidated damages payable to our customers resulting in decreased profitability. If our ground operations at project sites, our manufacturing facilities and\nour suppliers or vendors are so affected in the future, our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments may be delayed, which could adversely affect\nour business, operations, and customer relationships.\n\nWe have encountered and could encounter in the future project delays and resulting liquidated damages claims from customers due to impacts arising\nfrom or related to actual or threatened health epidemics, pandemics or similar public health threats on suppliers, customers, or others. The duration and\nintensity of these potential impacts and resulting disruption to our operations is uncertain and continues to evolve. The extent to which these events may\nimpact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Accordingly, to the extent any\nsuch actual or threatened health epidemics, pandemics or similar public health threat arises, management will monitor the impact of the global situation on\nits financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce.\n\nThe scope and duration of a pandemic, epidemic or other similar public health threat, including any future resurgences, the pace at which government\nrestrictions, if any, are implemented to contain a virus and then lifted, the impact on our customers and suppliers, the speed and extent to which markets\nrecover from the disruptions caused by a pandemic, epidemic, or other similar public health threat, and the impact of these factors on our business will\ndepend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The impact of a pandemic, epidemic, or other similar\npublic  health  threat  may  also  exacerbate  other  risks  discussed  herein,  any  of  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  results  of\noperations, or financial condition.\n\nRisks Related to Our Industry\n\nIf renewable energy technologies are not suitable for widespread adoption or sufficient demand for our hardware and software-enabled services does\nnot develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, our sales may decline, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\n\nThe market for renewable, distributed energy generation is emerging and rapidly evolving, and its future success and trajectory is uncertain and subject\n\nto a number of risks. If renewable energy generation proves unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment\n\n28\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##or if demand for our energy storage products and solutions and software-enabled services fails to develop as currently anticipated, our revenue, market\nshare, and our ability to achieve and/or sustain profitability may be adversely affected.\n\nMany factors may influence the widespread adoption of renewable energy generation and demand for our hardware and software-enabled services,\nincluding, but not limited to, the cost-effectiveness of renewable energy technologies as compared with conventional and competitive technologies, the\nperformance and reliability of renewable energy products as compared with conventional and non-renewable products, fluctuations in economic and market\nconditions that impact the viability of conventional and competitive alternative energy sources, increases or decreases in the prices of oil, coal and natural\ngas, continued deregulation of the electric power industry and broader energy industry, governmental regulations regarding renewable energy generation,\nand  the  availability  or  effectiveness  of  government  subsidies  and  incentives.  The  growth  of  renewable  energy  generation  is  relevant  to  the  demand  for\nenergy storage because increases in intermittent solar and wind power in many jurisdictions have spurred the demand for energy storage to help maintain\nreliability and support the integration of solar and wind power into the electrical grid.\n\nThe growth and profitability of our business is largely dependent upon the continued decline in the overall cost of battery storage. Over the last decade\nthe cost of battery storage products, particularly lithium-ion based battery storage products, have declined significantly. This lower cost has been driven by\nadvances in battery technology, maturation of the battery supply chain, the scale of battery production by the leading manufacturers and other factors. The\ngrowth of our hardware sales and related software-enabled services is dependent upon the continued decrease in the price and efficiency of battery storage\nproducts of our component OEM suppliers. However, in fiscal year 2022, we saw battery prices increase for the first time and as a result, we had to evolve\nand adopt a different contracting strategy to ensure preservation of margin in such instance. If for any reason going forward our component OEM suppliers\nare unable to continue to reduce the price of their components, our business and financial condition may be negatively impacted. Additionally, the growth\nand profitability of our business is dependent on domestic supply chains that have not yet begun commercial operations. Delays in the construction of these\ndomestic supply chains could cause delays to our projects and could result in lower sales, profitability, and potentially canceled contracts. This could harm\nour relationships with our customers if projects are delayed.\n\nIf the estimates and assumptions we use to determine the size of our total addressable market are inaccurate, our future growth rate may be affected,\nand the potential growth of our business may be limited.\n\nMarket  estimates  and  growth  forecasts  are  subject  to  significant  uncertainty  and  are  based  on  assumptions  and  estimates  that  may  prove  to  be\ninaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nThe assumptions relating to our market opportunities include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) according to BloombergNEF, global energy storage\ncapacity grew 63% per annum between 2015 and 2020 based on the Energy Storage Market Outlook dated October 2022 and is expected to grow at a further\n27% compound annual growth rate through 2030 based on the Energy Storage Market Outlook dated October 2023; (ii) declines in overall lithium-ion\nbattery costs and in the cost of renewable generation; (iii) growing demand for renewable energy; and (iv) increased complexity of the electrical grid. Our\nmarket opportunities are also based on the assumption that our existing and future offerings will be more attractive to our customers and potential customers\nthan competing products and services. If these assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected. For more information regarding our estimates of market opportunity and the forecasts of market growth included herein, see the section entitled\n\u201cBusiness.\u201d\nExisting electric utility industry policies and regulations, and any subsequent changes, may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the\npurchase and use of energy storage products that may significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete.\n\nFederal, state, local, and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the broader electric utility industry, as well as internal policies and\nregulations promulgated by electric utilities and organized electric markets with respect to fees, practices, and rate design, can influence the market for\nenergy storage products and services. These regulations and policies often affect electricity pricing and the interconnection of generation facilities, and can\nbe subject to frequent modifications by governments, regulatory bodies, utilities, and market operators. For example, changes in fee structures, electricity\npricing  structures,  and  system  permitting,  interconnection,  and  operating  requirements  can  deter  purchases  of  renewable  energy  products  by  reducing\nanticipated  revenues  or  increasing  costs  or  regulatory  burdens  for  would-be  system  purchasers.  The  resulting  reductions  in  demand  for  energy  storage\nproducts could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nA significant recent development in renewable-energy pricing policies in the U.S. occurred on July 16, 2020, when the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission  (\u201cFERC\u201d)  issued  a  final  rule  amending  regulations  that  implement  the  Public  Utility  Regulatory  Policies  Act  (\u201cPURPA\u201d).  Among  other\nrequirements, PURPA mandates that electric utilities buy the output of certain renewable generators below established capacity thresholds. PURPA also\nrequires that such sales occur at an utility\u2019s \u201cavoided cost\u201d rate. FERC\u2019s PURPA reforms include modifications (1) to how regulators and electric utilities\nmay  establish  avoided  cost  rates  for  new  contracts;  (2)  that  reduce  from  20  MW  to  5  MW,  the  capacity  threshold  above  which  there  is  a  rebuttable\npresumption that a renewable-energy qualifying facility has nondiscriminatory market access, thereby removing the requirement for utilities to purchase its\noutput; (3) that require regulators to establish criteria for determining when an electric utility incurs a legally enforceable obligation to purchase from a\nPURPA facility; and (4) that reduce barriers for third parties to challenge PURPA eligibility. In general, FERC\u2019s PURPA reforms have the potential to\nreduce prices for the output from certain new renewable generation projects while also\n\n29\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##narrowing the scope of PURPA eligibility for new projects. These effects could reduce demand for PURPA-eligible battery energy storage products and\ncould harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nChanges  in  other  current  laws  or  regulations  applicable  to  us  or  the  imposition  of  new  laws,  regulations,  or  policies  in  the  U.S.,  Europe,  or  other\njurisdictions in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any changes to\ngovernment, utility, or electric market regulations or policies that favor electric utilities or other market participants could reduce the competitiveness of\nbattery energy storage products and cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services and adversely impact our growth.\n\nThe economic benefit of our offerings to our customers depends on the cost of electricity available from alternative sources, including local electric\nutility companies, which cost structure is subject to change.\n\nThe  economic  benefit  of  our  energy  storage  products  and  solutions  to  our  customers  includes,  among  other  things,  the  benefit  of  reducing  such\ncustomers\u2019 payments to the local electric utility company. The rates at which electricity is available from a customer\u2019s local electric utility company is\nsubject to change and any changes in such rates may affect the relative benefits of our energy storage products. Factors that could influence these rates\ninclude  the  effect  of  energy  conservation  initiatives  that  reduce  electricity  consumption,  construction  of  additional  power  generation  plants  (including\nnuclear,  coal  or  natural  gas),  and  technological  developments  by  others  in  the  electric  power  industry.  Further,  the  local  electric  utility  may  impose\n\u201cdeparting load,\u201d \u201cstandby\u201d or other charges on our customers in connection with their acquisition of our energy storage products, the amounts of which are\noutside of our control and which may have a material impact on the overall economic benefit of our energy storage products to and cost analysis for our\ncustomers of our energy storage products. Changes in the rates offered by local electric utilities and/or in the applicability or amounts of charges and other\nfees imposed by such utilities on customers acquiring our energy storage products could adversely affect the demand for our energy storage products.\n\nAn increase in interest rates or a reduction in the availability of tax equity or project debt capital in the global financial markets could make it difficult\nfor end customers to finance the cost of a renewable energy storage system and could reduce the demand for our products.\n\nMany end users depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase our products and services as a result of the significant\nup-front costs. Their ability to attract third-party financing depends on many factors that are outside of our control, including the ability of third parties to\nutilize tax credits and other government incentives, interest rate and/or currency exchange fluctuations, their perceived creditworthiness and the condition of\ncredit markets generally. As a result, an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt or tax equity financing could reduce the number\nof customer projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or their customers to secure the financing necessary to construct\na renewable energy system on favorable terms, or at all, and thus lower demand for our products, which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales. In\naddition, we believe that a significant percentage of end-users construct renewable energy storage systems as an investment, funding a significant portion of\nthe initial capital expenditure with financing from third parties. An increase in interest rates could lower an investor\u2019s return on investment, increase equity\nrequirements, or make alternative investments more attractive relative to our products and services and, in each case, could cause these end users to seek\nalternative investments.\n\nChanges in tax laws or regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nChanges in corporate tax rates, tax incentives for renewable energy projects, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our U.S. operations, the\ntaxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under future tax reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred\ntax assets, could result in significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense, any and all of\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nGovernmental  agencies  in  the  jurisdictions  in  which  we  and  our  affiliates  do  business,  as  well  as  the  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and\nDevelopment (the \u201cOECD\u201d), have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational business, including issues relating to \u201cbase erosion and\nprofit  shifting,\u201d  where  profits  are  reported  as  earned  for  tax  purposes  in  relatively  low-tax  jurisdictions  or  payments  are  made  between  affiliates  in\njurisdictions with different tax rates. The OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for\naddressing  base  erosion  and  profit  shifting,  and  governmental  authorities  from  various  jurisdictions  (including  the  United  States)  continue  to  discuss\npotential legislation and other reforms, including proposals for global minimum tax rates.\n\nAs  we  operate  in  numerous  jurisdictions,  the  application  of  tax  laws  can  be  subject  to  diverging  and  sometimes  conflicting  interpretations  by  tax\nauthorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance with respect to\nwhether a permanent establishment exists in a particular jurisdiction, the manner in which an arm\u2019s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes,\nor with respect to the valuations of intellectual property. For example, if a taxing authority in one country where we operate were to reallocate income from\nanother country where we operate, and\n\n30\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##if the taxing authority in the second country did not agree with the reallocation asserted by the first country, then we could be subject to tax on the same\nincome in both countries, resulting in double taxation. If taxing authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double\ntaxation or assess interest and penalties, our tax liabilities could increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n\nDue to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining\nto  recent  tax  reforms  in  the  United  States),  the  ambiguity  of  tax  laws  and  regulations,  the  subjectivity  of  factual  interpretations,  the  complexity  of  our\nintercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective tax\nrate and income tax assets and liabilities may be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected, and the resulting impacts may vary\nsubstantially from period to period.\n\nIn  particular,  in  the  United  States,  there  have  been  multiple  significant  changes  recently  proposed  or  enacted  to  the  taxation  of  business  entities\n(including  the  passing  of  the  IRA),  including,  among  other  things,  implementing  a  15%  corporate  minimum  tax  on  book  income  of  certain  large\ncorporations effective in 2024, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022, and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. We\nare still evaluating the impact these IRA-related tax incentives may have on our financial results as we go forward. Additionally, we are currently unable to\npredict whether other proposed changes to tax laws will be enacted and, if so, when they would be effective or the ultimate impact on us or our business. To\nthe  extent  that  such  changes  have  a  negative  impact  on  us  or  our  business,  these  changes  may  materially  and  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, the amounts of taxes we pay are subject to current or future audits by taxing authorities in the United States and all other jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. If audits result in additional payments or assessments, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities, and\nour financial statements could be adversely affected.\n\nWe  may  incur  obligations,  liabilities,  or  costs  under  environmental,  health,  and  safety  laws,  which  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe are required to comply with federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment, health, and safety.\nWe may incur expenses, or be subject to liability, related to the transportation, storage, or disposal of lithium-ion batteries, or other materials used in our\nproducts. Adoption of more stringent laws and regulations in the future could require us to incur substantial costs to come into compliance with these laws\nand regulations. In addition, violations of, or liabilities under, these laws and regulations may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities\nor in our being subject to adverse publicity, substantial fines, penalties, criminal proceedings, third-party property damage or personal injury claims, cleanup\ncosts, or other costs. Liability under these laws and regulations can be imposed on a joint and several basis and without regard to fault or the legality of the\nactivities giving rise to the claim. In addition, future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies or the discovery of presently unknown\nenvironmental conditions may require expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nThe reduction, elimination, or expiration of government incentives for, or regulations mandating the use of, renewable energy could reduce demand for\nenergy storage products and harm our business.\n\nFederal,  state,  local,  and  foreign  government  bodies  provide  incentives  to  owners,  end  users,  distributors,  system  integrators  and  manufacturers  of\nrenewable energy products to promote renewable electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives. The range and duration of these\nincentives varies widely by jurisdiction. Our customers typically use our products for grid-connected applications wherein power is sold under a power\npurchase agreement or into an organized electric market. The reduction, elimination, or expiration of government incentives for grid-connected electricity\nmay negatively affect the competitiveness of our offerings relative to conventional renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of our\nindustry and our business. These subsidies and incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or\nterminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase or as a result of legal challenges, the adoption of new statutes or regulations, or the passage of time.\nThese reductions or terminations may occur without warning. There is no guarantee that such policies and incentives will continue to exist in current form,\nif at all. The reduction, elimination or expiration of such incentives therefore could reduce demand for our offerings and therefore could harm our business,\noperating results, and cash flows.\n\nIn August 2022, the United States passed the IRA, which includes a number of government incentives that support the adoption of energy storage\nproducts  and  services  and  are  anticipated  to  benefit  the  Company  and  its  operations.  The  impact  of  the  IRA  and  its  accompanying  guidance  on  our\noperations cannot be known with certainty and we may not recognize the benefits we anticipate. We are continuing to evaluate the potential overall impact\nand applicability of the IRA on our business and operations. To the extent that any impacts from the IRA are less beneficial than anticipated or have a\nnegative impact on us or our business or on our customers\u2019 businesses, these changes may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\n\n31\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Revenue from any projects we support may be adversely affected if there is a decline in public acceptance or support of renewable energy, or regulatory\nagencies, local communities, or other third parties delay, prevent, or increase the cost of constructing and operating customer projects.\n\nCertain persons, associations and groups could oppose renewable energy projects in general or our customers\u2019 projects specifically, citing, for example,\nmisuse of water resources, landscape degradation, land use, food scarcity or price increase, and harm to the environment. Moreover, regulation may restrict\nthe development of renewable energy plants in certain areas. In order to develop a renewable energy project, our customers are typically required to obtain,\namong other things, environmental impact permits or other authorizations and building permits, which in turn require environmental impact studies to be\nundertaken and public hearings and comment periods to be held during which any person, association, or group may oppose a project. Any such opposition\nmay be taken into account by government officials responsible for granting the relevant permits, which could result in the permits being delayed or not\nbeing granted or being granted solely on the condition that our customers carry out certain corrective measures to the proposed project, and opposition to a\nproject could lead to legal challenges by opponents to an agency\u2019s approval of the project permits.\n\nSevere weather events, including the effects of climate change, are inherently unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our financial\nresults and financial condition.\n\nOur  business,  including  our  customers  and  suppliers,  may  be  exposed  to  severe  weather  events  and  natural  disasters,  such  as  tornadoes,  tsunamis,\ntropical storms (including hurricanes), earthquakes, windstorms, hailstorms, severe thunderstorms, wildfires, and other fires, which could cause operating\nresults to vary significantly from one period to the next. We may incur losses in our business in excess of: (1) those experienced in prior years, (2) the\naverage expected level used in pricing, or (3) current insurance coverage limits. The incidence and severity of severe weather conditions and other natural\ndisasters are inherently unpredictable. Climate change is anticipated to increase the occurrence of certain natural events, such as an increase in the frequency\nor severity of wind and thunderstorm events, and tornado or hailstorm events; more frequent wildfires and subsequent landslides in certain geographies;\nhigher incidence of deluge flooding; and the potential for an increase in severity of the hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures. Climate\nchange may also result in chronic physical changes, such as changes to temperature or precipitation patterns or rising sea levels that may also adversely\nimpact  the  suitability  of  certain  project  sites  or  otherwise  adversely  impact  our  business.  Evolving  market  conditions,  shift  in  global  policy  on  climate\nchange,  and  the  increase  in  frequency  and  impact  of  extreme  weather  events  on  critical  infrastructure  globally  as  a  result  of  climate  change  have  the\npotential to disrupt our business, the business of our suppliers and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and\nadditional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, climate change may adversely impact the demand, price, and availability of insurance that\nmay be available to us and to our customers at project sites. While we may take various actions to mitigate our business risks associated with climate\nchange, this may require us to incur substantial costs and may not be successful, due to, among other things, the uncertainty associated with the longer-term\nprojections associated with managing climate risks.\n\nIncreasing attention to, and evolving expectations regarding, ESG matters may impact our business and reputation.\n\nCompanies across industries are facing increasing scrutiny from a variety of stakeholders related to their ESG and sustainability practices. Expectations\nregarding  voluntary  ESG  initiatives  and  disclosures  may  result  in  increased  costs  (including  but  not  limited  to  increased  costs  related  to  compliance,\nstakeholder  engagement,  contracting  and  insurance),  changes  in  demand  for  certain  products,  enhanced  compliance  or  disclosure  obligations,  or  other\nimpacts to our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\nWhile we have in past, and expect in future to continue, engaged in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications, or goals, among\nothers) to improve the ESG profile of our Company and/or products or to respond to stakeholder expectations, such initiatives may be costly and may not\nhave the desired effect. Expectations around company\u2019s management of ESG matters continues to evolve rapidly, in many instances due to factors that are\nout of our control. For example, we may ultimately be unable to complete certain initiatives or targets, either on the timelines initially announced or at all,\ndue to technological, legal, cost, or other constraints, which may be within or outside of our control. Moreover, actions or statements that we may take based\non expectations, assumptions, or third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be\nsubject to misinterpretation. If we fail to, or are perceived to fail to, comply with or advance certain ESG initiatives (including the timeline and manner in\nwhich we complete such initiatives), we may be subject to various adverse impacts, including reputational damage and potential stakeholder engagement\nand/or litigation, even if such initiatives are currently voluntary. For example, there have been increasing allegations of greenwashing against companies\nmaking significant ESG claims due to a variety of perceived deficiencies in performance, including as stakeholder perceptions of sustainability continue to\nevolve. Companies, such as us, involved in the energy transition may be especially impacted by such criticisms, due to our efforts to position our business\nplan focusing on helping customers achieve sustainability-related goals and objectives.\n\nWe  expect  there  will  likely  be  increasing  levels  of  regulation,  disclosure-related  and  otherwise,  with  respect  to  ESG  matters.  For  example,various\npolicymakers, such as the SEC and the State of California, have adopted, or are considering adopting rules to require companies to provide significantly\nexpanded  climate-related  disclosures  in  their  periodic  reporting,  which  may  require  us  to  incur  significant  additional  costs  to  comply,  including  the\nimplementation of significant additional internal controls processes and procedures regarding matters that have not been subject to such controls in the past,\nand impose increased oversight obligations on our\n\n32\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##management and board of directors. Simultaneously, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce companies\u2019 efforts on certain ESG-related matters.\nBoth advocates and opponents to certain ESG matters are increasingly resorting to a range of activism forms, including media campaigns and litigation, to\nadvance their perspectives. To the extent we are subject to such activism, it may require us to incur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This\nand other stakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risks identified in this risk factor.\nAdditionally, many of our customers and suppliers may be subject to similar expectations, which may augment or create additional risks, including risks that\nmay not be known to us.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Liquidity\n\nOur ABL Credit Agreement imposes certain restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our business and make payments on our indebtedness.\n\nWe  are  party  to  an  asset-based  syndicated  credit  agreement  (the  \u201cABL  Credit  Agreement\u201d)  with  revolving  commitments  in  an  aggregate  principal\namount  of  $400.0  million  (the  \u201cABL  Facility\u201d).  The  ABL  Credit  Agreement  contains  covenants  that,  among  other  things,  restrict  our  ability  to  incur\nindebtedness; incur liens; sell, transfer, or dispose of property and assets; invest; pay dividends, make distributions or other restricted payments and engage\nin affiliate transactions. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Liquidity and Capital Resources\u2014\nABL Facility\u201d for further discussion of the ABL Facility. The terms of the ABL Credit Agreement limits Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries ability to\npay cash dividends to, lend to, or make other investments in Fluence Energy, Inc., subject to certain exceptions, including certain payments under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement are permitted. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Liquidity and Capital\nResources\u2014Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for further discussion of the Tax Receivable Agreement. These restrictions may restrict our current and future\noperations, particularly our ability to respond to certain changes in our business or industry or take future actions.\n\nOur  ability  to  meet  these  restrictive  covenants  can  be  impacted  by  events  beyond  our  control  and  we  may  be  unable  to  do  so.  Our  ABL  Credit\nAgreement  and  related  security  agreements  provides  that  our  breach  or  failure  to  satisfy  certain  covenants  constitutes  an  event  of  default.  Upon  the\noccurrence of an event of default, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under its debt agreements to be immediately due and payable. In\naddition,  our  lenders,  to  whom  we  granted  a  security  interest  in  substantially  all  of  our  assets,  would  have  the  right  to  proceed  against  such  assets  we\nprovided as collateral pursuant to the ABL Credit Agreement and related security agreement. If the debt under our ABL Facility was to be accelerated, we\nmay not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay it, which would have an immediate adverse effect on our business and\noperating results. This could potentially cause us to cease operations and result in a complete loss of your investment in our Class A common stock.\n\nIn addition, availability under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculated based on a percentage of Net Orderly Liquidation Value (as\ndefined in the ABL Credit Agreement), which, in turn, may be impacted by factors outside of our control, including demand for the Company\u2019s products,\ncompetition with producers of similar products and supply chain factors. As such, we may not have full access to our current ABL Facility availability based\non the actual borrowing base calculation at any future period. Should our borrowing base under the ABL Facility decline, our ability to borrow against the\nABL Facility to fund future operations and business transactions could be limited.\n\nMoreover, the ABL Credit Agreement requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to interest payments, thereby reducing the\navailability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; increasing our vulnerability to adverse general\neconomic, industry, or competitive developments or conditions; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the\nindustry in which we operate or in pursuing our strategic objectives.\n\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on acceptable\nterms or at all.\n\nWe  believe  that  our  current  cash  and  cash  equivalents  together  with  our  expected  cash  from  operations,  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  our  projected\noperating requirements for the foreseeable future. However, continued expansion of our business will be expensive, and we may seek additional funds from\npublic and private stock offerings, borrowings under our existing or new credit facilities or other sources which we may not be able to maintain or obtain on\nacceptable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\n\u2022 market acceptance of our offerings;\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nthe revenue generated by sales of our offerings;\nthe costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe expenses we incur in manufacturing and selling our products;\n\n33\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nthe costs of developing and commercializing new products or technologies;\nthe cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights;\nthe cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property rights;\nthe cost of enforcing or defending against non-competition claims;\nthe number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\nthe costs associated with our planned international expansion; and\nunanticipated general and administrative expenses.\n\ncontinue our research and development and protect our intellectual property rights;\ndefend claims, in litigation or otherwise;\nexpand our geographic reach;\ncommercialize our new products; and\nacquire companies and license products or intellectual property.\n\nAs a result of these factors, we may seek to raise additional capital to, among others:\n\u2022 maintain appropriate product inventory levels;\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nSuch capital may not be available on favorable terms to us, if at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional capital, our\nexisting stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our\nexisting  stockholders.  In  addition,  if  we  raise  additional  capital  through  collaboration,  licensing,  or  other  similar  arrangements,  it  may  be  necessary  to\nrelinquish valuable rights to our products, potential products, or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are\nunable to rely on our standalone credit quality or utilize such credit support tools like parent company guarantees, letters of credit, or surety bonds going\nforward, it may impact our ability to sell products or establish customer and supplier relationships going forward. If we cannot raise capital on acceptable\nterms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our product, service, and digital application offerings, execute our business plan, take advantage of future\nopportunities, or respond to competitive pressures, changes in our supplier relationships, or unanticipated customer requirements. Any of these events could\nadversely affect our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\n\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property, Data Privacy and Technology\n\nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce adequate protection for our intellectual property or if the scope of our intellectual property protection\nis not sufficiently broad, others may be able to develop and commercialize technology and intellectual property substantially similar to ours, and our\nability to successfully commercialize our technology or intellectual property may be adversely affected.\n\nOur business depends on internally developed technology or other internally developed intellectual property, including hardware, software, databases,\nsystems, confidential information and know-how, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent,\ntrademark, trade-secret, and copyright laws as well as internal confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish, maintain, and protect our\nintellectual property rights in our internally developed technology and other intellectual property. However, our rights under these laws and agreements only\nafford us limited protection and the actions we take to establish, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient. We may, over\ntime,  take  additional  steps  in  protecting  our  intellectual  property  through  growing  our  IP  team  and  through  additional  trademark,  patent,  and  other\nintellectual property filings both in the United States and abroad that could be expensive and time-consuming. Effective patent protection is expensive to\ndevelop and maintain and while it is generally less costly to obtain trademark and copyright protection, the aggregate costs of maintaining a portfolio of\npatents and registered copyrights and trademarks can be substantial, both in terms of initial and ongoing prosecution and maintenance requirements and the\ncosts of enforcing and defending our rights. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, these measures taken to date may not be sufficient to\noffer  us  meaningful  protection  from  our  competitors  or  other  third  parties  from  attempting  to  copy,  reverse  engineer,  or  otherwise  obtain  and  use  our\nintellectual  property.  If  we  are  unable  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights,  our  competitive  position  could  be  harmed,  business  opportunities  and\ndemand for our products, services and digital application offerings could decrease, and our business could be adversely impacted as third parties may be\nable  to  commercialize  and  use  technologies,  software  products  and  intellectual  property  that  are  substantially  the  same  as  ours  without  incurring  the\ndevelopment and licensing costs that we have incurred.\n\n34\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated, and our trade\nsecrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third parties. Some of our services rely on technologies and\nsoftware developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar\nrelationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Further, in some cases, our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to circumvent third\nparty intellectual property and thereby not permit us to take advantage of market trends nor providing us with competitive advantages, which could result in\ncostly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain offerings, or other competitive harm.\n\nAdditionally,  monitoring  unauthorized  use  of  our  intellectual  property  is  cumbersome  and  costly  and  there  is  no  guarantee  that  any  steps  taken  to\nprevent misappropriation will be successful. In the future, we may seek to enforce our rights against potential infringement, however, the steps we have\ntaken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent actual infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may\nnot be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may have to resort to\nlitigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.\n\nUncertainty may result from changes in intellectual property laws as a result of new legislation and from new interpretations of intellectual property\nlaws by applicable courts and agencies throughout the world. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to obtain and maintain the intellectual\nproperty rights necessary to provide us with a competitive advantage. Our failure to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights could\ntherefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nAs a technology company selling commercial products, we run the risk of being sued by third parties for infringement, misappropriation, dilution, or\nother violation of their intellectual property or proprietary rights.\n\nTechnology, internet, advertising, and in general most companies involved with commercially selling products, frequently are subject to litigation based\non allegations of infringement, misappropriation, dilution, or other violations of intellectual property rights. Some of these companies, including some of our\ncompetitors, as well as non-practicing entities, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, which they may use to assert claims\nagainst us. For instance, the use of our technology to provide our offerings could be challenged by claims that such use infringes, dilutes, misappropriates, or\notherwise violates the intellectual property rights of a third party. In addition, we may in the future be exposed to claims that content published or made\navailable through our applications or websites violates third-party intellectual property rights.\n\nAs we face increasing competition and as a public company, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. Such claims and\nlitigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property rights holders who have no relevant product revenue, and therefore\nour own pending patents and other intellectual property rights may provide little or no deterrence to these rights holders in bringing intellectual property\nrights claims against us. Third parties may hold intellectual property rights that cover significant aspects of our technologies, content, branding, or business\nmethods, and we cannot assure that we are not infringing or violating, and have not violated or infringed, any third-party intellectual property rights or that\nwe will not be held to have done so or be accused of doing so in the future. We may not be aware of existing patents or patent applications that could be\npertinent  to  our  business  as  many  patent  applications  are  filed  confidentially  in  the  United  States  and  are  not  published  until  18  months  following  the\napplicable filing date. We expect that we may receive in the future notices that claim we or our customers using our energy storage solutions, services or\ndigital applications, have infringed or misappropriated, other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, particularly as the number of competitors in our market\ngrows and the functionality of applications amongst competitors overlaps.\n\nAny claim that we have violated intellectual property or other proprietary rights of third parties, with or without merit, and whether or not it results in\nlitigation, is settled out of court or is determined in our favor, could be time-consuming and costly to address and resolve, and could divert the time and\nattention of management and technical personnel from our business and the day-to-day operations. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may result\nin an injunction and could require us to pay substantial monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully\ninfringed a party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to enter into a licensing\nagreement  to  continue  using  the  technology,  content,  or  other  intellectual  property  that  is  the  subject  of  the  claim;  restrict  or  prohibit  our  use  of  such\ntechnology, content, or other intellectual property; require us to expend significant resources to redesign our technology or solutions; and require us to\nindemnify third parties. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required or desirable, may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms that are acceptable\nto  us,  or  at  all,  and  may  require  significant  royalty  payments  and  other  expenditures.  We  may  also  be  required  to  develop  alternative  non-infringing\ntechnology, which could require significant time and expense and diversion of resources. There also can be no assurance that we would be able to develop or\nlicense suitable alternative technology, content, or other intellectual property to permit us to continue offering the affected technology, content, or services to\nour customers. If we cannot develop or license technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our offerings and\nmay be unable to compete as effectively, if at all. Any of these events could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n35\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected or protectable, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest,\nand our competitive position may be harmed.\n\nThe registered and unregistered trademarks and trade names that we own may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic, lapsed, or\ndetermined to be infringing on or dilutive of other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in\norder to build name recognition with potential members, partners, and clients. In addition, third parties may file for registration of trademarks similar or\nidentical to our trademarks, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. If they succeed in registering or\ndeveloping common-law rights in such trademarks, and if we are not successful in challenging such third-party rights, we may not be able to use these\ntrademarks to develop brand recognition of our technologies, products, or services. In addition, there could be potential trademark infringement claims\nbrought by owners of other registered or unregistered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or\ntrade names. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\n\nAs the geographic scope of our business expands, we will need to consider protecting our proprietary technology and other intellectual property in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful, and accordingly we may choose not to do so in every location.\nFiling, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing intellectual property rights on our products, services, digital applications, and technologies in all\ncountries throughout the world could be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less\nextensive than those in the United States. We do not own and have not registered or applied for intellectual property registrations in all countries outside the\nUnited States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained protection to develop their own products, services, digital\napplications, and technologies and, further, may export otherwise violating products and services to territories where we have protection but enforcement is\nnot as strong as that in the United States. These products, services, digital applications, and technologies may compete with our products, services, digital\napplications, and technologies, and our intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. In addition, the laws\nof some foreign countries do not protect certain proprietary and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many\nother companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing certain of their proprietary and intellectual property rights outside of\nthe  United  States.  These  challenges  can  be  caused  by  the  absence  or  inconsistency  of  the  application  of  rules  and  methods  for  the  establishment  and\nenforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the United States. For instance, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject\nmatter  or  the  scope  of  claims  allowable  for  business  methods.  As  such,  we  do  not  know  the  degree  of  future  protection  that  we  will  have  on  our\ntechnologies, products, services, and digital applications.\n\nIn addition, the legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of intellectual property rights to the\nsame degree at the United States. This could make it difficult for us to stop the misappropriation, dilution, infringement, or other violation of certain of our\nintellectual property rights. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of intellectual property\nprotection in such countries. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our\nefforts  and  attention  from  other  aspects  of  our  business.  In  addition,  our  efforts  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights  in  such  countries  may  be\ninadequate. Changes in the law and the interpretation thereof as well as legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our\nability to obtain, maintain, and enforce adequate intellectual property protection for our products, services, digital applications, and other technologies. Any\nof the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or\nformer employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\n\nMany of our employees, consultants, and advisors are currently or were previously employed at other companies in our field, including our competitors\nor potential future competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how\nof others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or\nother proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in\ndefending  any  such  claims,  in  addition  to  paying  monetary  damages,  we  may  lose  valuable  intellectual  property  rights  or  personnel.  Even  if  we  are\nsuccessful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\n\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual\nproperty to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in\nfact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the\nassignment agreements may be breached, and we may be\n\n36\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual\nproperty. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nIf our existing patents expire or are not maintained, our pending patent applications are not granted or our patent rights are contested, circumvented,\ninvalidated or limited in scope, we may not be able to prevent others from selling, developing or exploiting competing technologies, products, services or\ndigital applications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will issue as patents. Even if our patent applications result in issued patents, these\npatents  may  be  contested,  circumvented,  or  invalidated  in  the  future.  In  addition,  the  rights  granted  under  any  issued  patents  may  not  provide  us  with\nadequate protection or competitive advantages that we anticipate against competitors or other third parties. The claims under any patents that issue from our\npatent applications may not be broad enough to prevent others from developing competing technologies that are similar or that achieve results similar to\nours. The intellectual property rights of others could also bar us from licensing and exploiting any patents that issue from our pending applications. There\nare a number of patents and pending patent applications owned by competitors exist in the fields in which we have developed and are developing our\ntechnology.  Many  of  these  existing  patents  and  patent  applications  might  have  priority  over  our  patent  applications  and  could  subject  our  patents  to\ninvalidation or our patent applications to rejection. Finally, in addition to patents with an earlier priority date and patent applications that were filed before\nour patent applications that may affect the likelihood of issuance of patents we are seeking, any of our existing or future patents may also be challenged by\nothers on grounds that may render our patent applications or issued patents invalid or unenforceable. In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon\nor designed around by others which may adversely affect our business, prospects, and operating results.\n\nOur business depends on our ability to implement improvements to and properly maintain and protect the continuous operation and data integrity of our\ninformation technology infrastructure and other business systems and the inability to do so may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and\nharm our business prospects, financial conditions, and operating results.\n\nOur business is highly dependent on maintaining effective information systems as well as the integrity of the data we use to serve our customers and\noperate our business. Because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could\nresult in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers or other partners may\nregard as significant. If our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to fraud or other error, or if we, or any of the third-party service providers we\nengage,  were  to  fail  to  maintain  information  systems  and  data  integrity  effectively,  we  could  experience  operational  disruptions  that  may  impact  our\noperations and hinder our ability to provide services, establish appropriate pricing, establish reserves, report financial results timely and accurately and\nmaintain regulatory compliance, among other things. If any such failure of our data integrity were to result in the theft, corruption or other harm to the data\nof our customers, our ability to retain and attract partners or customers may be harmed.\n\nWe must continue to invest in long-term solutions that will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations, enhance the customer experience,\nact  as  a  differentiator  in  the  market,  and  protect  against  cybersecurity  risks  and  threats.  Despite  our  implementation  of  reasonable  security  measures\ndesigned to prevent cybersecurity risks and threats, we are vulnerable to potential harm and damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, fire, power\nloss, telecommunications failures, personnel misconduct or theft, human error, unauthorized access, physical or electronic security breaches, cyber-attacks\n(including malicious and destructive code, phishing attacks, ransomware, and denial of service attacks), and other similar disruptions. Such harm, damages,\nattacks or security breaches may be perpetrated by bad actors internally or externally (including computer hackers, persons involved with organized crime,\nor foreign state or foreign state-supported actors) and create risks for our (as well as our suppliers\u2019 and our customers\u2019) internal networks, IT infrastructure,\nand  other  business  systems  and  the  data  and  information  they  store  and  process.  Cybersecurity  threat  actors  employ  a  wide  variety  of  methods  and\ntechniques that are constantly evolving, increasingly sophisticated, and difficult to detect and successfully defend against. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts,\nsuch as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, may further heighten the risk of cyber-attacks. We have experienced such cybersecurity incidents in the past, and any\nfuture incidents could expose us to claims, litigation, regulatory or other governmental investigations, administrative fines, and potential liability. Moreover,\nwhile we have implemented remedial measures in response to such incidents, we cannot guarantee that such measures will prevent all incidents in the future.\nAny system failure, accident, or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems\ncould include the theft of our trade secrets, customer information, human resources information, or other confidential data, including but not limited to\npersonally identifiable information.\n\nAlthough past incidents have not had a material effect on our business operations or financial performance, to the extent that any disruption or security\nbreach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inadvertent disclosure of confidential, proprietary personal or customer information, it could cause\nsignificant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers and strategic partners, lead to claims against us from governments and\nprivate  plaintiffs,  and  adversely  affect  our  business.  We  cannot  guarantee  that  future  cyberattacks,  if  successful,  will  not  have  a  material  effect  on  our\nbusiness or financial results.\n\n37\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##In 2023, the SEC issued final rules related to cybersecurity risk management, strategy governance and incident disclosure, which may further increase\nour regulatory burden and the cost of compliance in such events. Public companies must comply with the cybersecurity incident reporting obligations by\nDecember 18, 2023 and must comply with the other disclosure obligations beginning with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15,\n2023. In addition, many governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of cyber incidents involving certain types of data, including\npersonal  information.  These  laws  may  be  subject  to  alterations  and  revisions,  and  if  we  fail  to  comply  with  our  obligations  under  such  laws  in  the\njurisdictions in which we operate, we could be subject to regulatory action and lawsuits. We may also have other obligations, for example, under contracts,\nto notify customers or other counterparties of a security incident, including a data security breach. Regardless of our contractual protections, if an actual or\nperceived cybersecurity breach of security measures, unauthorized access to our system or the systems of the third-party vendors that we rely upon, or any\nother cybersecurity threat occurs, we may incur liability, costs, or damages, contract termination, our reputation may be compromised, our ability to attract\nnew customers could be negatively affected, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any\ncompromise of our security could also result in a violation of applicable domestic and foreign security, privacy or data protection, consumer protection, and\nother laws, regulatory or other governmental investigations, enforcement actions, and legal and financial exposure, including potential contractual liability.\nIn addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against and remediate damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the\nfuture. While we carry cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue\nto be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\n\nWe utilize open-source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software and solutions.\n\nWe use open-source software in our solutions and will use open-source software in the future. Companies that incorporate open-source software into\ntheir solutions have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the use of open-source software and compliance with open-source license terms. Some\nlicenses governing the use of open-source software contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create\nbased upon the open-source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open-source license or other\nlicense granting third parties certain rights of further use. By the terms of certain open-source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of\nour proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open-source licenses to third parties at no cost, if we combine or distribute\nour proprietary software with open-source software in certain manners. Although we monitor our use of open-source software, we cannot assure you that all\nopen-source software is reviewed prior to use in our solutions, that our developers have not incorporated open-source software into our solutions, or that\nthey will not do so in the future. Additionally, the terms of many open-source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign\ncourts. There is a risk that open-source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability\nto market or provide our solutions as currently marketed or provided. Companies that incorporate open-source software into their products have, in the past,\nfaced claims seeking enforcement of open-source license provisions and claims asserting ownership of open-source software incorporated into their product.\nIf an author or other third party that distributes such open-source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of an open-source\nlicense, we could incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations. In the event such claims were successful, we could be subject to\nsignificant damages or be enjoined from the distribution of our software. In addition, the terms of open-source software licenses may require us to provide\nsource code that we develop using such open-source software to others on unfavorable license terms. As a result of our current or future use of open-source\nsoftware, we may face claims or litigation, be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our solutions,\ndiscontinue making our solutions available in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action. Any such re-\nengineering  or  other  remedial  efforts  could  require  significant  additional  research  and  development  resources,  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  successfully\ncomplete any such re-engineering or other remedial efforts. Further, in addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open-source software\ncan lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin\nof software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a negative effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under license or technology agreements with third parties, we may be required to pay damages, and we could\nlose license rights that are critical to our business. If we fail to comply with our obligations under license and technology agreements with AES and\nSiemens, we could lose license rights, including to patents and patent applications, which may prove to be material to our business.\n\nWe license certain intellectual property, including patents, technologies, and software from third parties and related parties, including AES and Siemens,\nthat are important to our business, and in the future, we may enter into additional agreements that provide us with licenses to valuable intellectual property\nor technology. If we fail to comply with any of the obligations under our license agreements, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have\nthe right to terminate the license. Termination by the licensor would cause us to lose valuable rights, and could prevent us from selling our products and\nservices,  or  adversely  impact  our  ability  to  commercialize  future  solutions  and  services.  Our  business  would  suffer  if  any  current  or  future  licenses\nterminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, if the licensors fail to enforce licensed patents against infringing third parties, if the\n\n38\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##licensed intellectual property is found to be invalid or unenforceable, if the licensed intellectual property expires or if we are unable to enter into necessary\nlicenses on acceptable terms. In addition, our rights to certain intellectual property, technologies, and software, are licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis.\nThe owners of these non-exclusively licensed technologies are therefore free to license them to third parties, including our competitors, on terms that may be\nsuperior to those offered to us, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has\nnot been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor\u2019s\nrights.  In  addition,  the  agreements  under  which  we  license  intellectual  property  or  technology  from  third  parties  are  generally  complex,  and  certain\nprovisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could\nnarrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or\nother  obligations  under  the  relevant  agreement.  Any  of  the  foregoing  could  harm  our  competitive  position,  business,  financial  condition,  results  of\noperations, and prospects.\n\nIf we cannot license rights to use technologies on reasonable terms, we may not be able to commercialize new solutions or services in the future.\n\nIn  the  future,  we  may  identify  additional  third-party  intellectual  property  we  may  need  to  license  in  order  to  engage  in  our  business,  including  to\ndevelop or commercialize new products or services. However, such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. The licensing or acquisition\nof third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-\nparty intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due\nto their size, capital resources, and greater development or commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be\nunwilling to assign or license rights to us. Even if such licenses are available, we may be required to pay the licensor substantial royalties based on sales of\nour products and services. Such royalties are a component of the cost of our products or services and may affect the margins on our products and services. In\naddition, such licenses may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same intellectual property licensed to us. If we are unable to\nenter into the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all, if any necessary licenses are subsequently terminated, if our licensors fail to abide by the\nterms of the licenses, if our licensors fail to prevent infringement by third parties, or if the licensed intellectual property rights are found to be invalid or\nunenforceable, or if the licensed intellectual property rights expire, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be affected.\nIf licenses to third-party intellectual property rights are or become required for us to engage in our business, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could\ngive our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. Moreover, we could encounter delays and other obstacles in\nour  attempt  to  develop  alternatives.  Defense  of  any  lawsuit  or  failure  to  obtain  any  of  these  licenses  on  favorable  terms  could  prevent  us  from\ncommercializing solutions and services, which could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nFailure to comply with data privacy and data security laws, regulations and industry standards could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,\nresults of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences.\n\nWe are subject to various laws, related regulations, and industry standards involving data privacy and information security. Such laws and regulations\nrelating to data privacy and information security are continuously evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may be\ninterpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As a result, our\npractices may not have complied in the past or may not comply now or in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations.\n\nIn the United States, there are numerous federal and state data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, use, storage,\nsharing,  transmission,  and  other  processing  of  personal  information,  including  federal  and  state  data  privacy  laws,  data  breach  notification  laws,  and\nconsumer protection laws. Many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to\nprivacy, data security, and data breaches. Such legislation includes the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which created new consumer rights, and\nimposes corresponding obligations on covered businesses, relating to the access to, deletion of, and sharing of personal information collected by covered\nbusinesses,  including  California  residents\u2019  right  to  access  and  delete  their  personal  information,  opt  out  of  certain  sharing  and  sales  of  their  personal\ninformation,  receive  detailed  information  about  how  their  personal  information  is  used  and  shared,  and  may  restrict  the  use  of  cookies  and  similar\ntechnologies  for  advertising  purposes.  The  CCPA  also  prohibits  discrimination  against  individuals  who  exercise  their  privacy  rights.  Additionally,  the\nCalifornia  Privacy  Rights  Act  (\u201cCPRA\u201d),  was  passed  in  California  in  November  2020  and  became  effective  in  July  2023  and  effectively  replaces  and\nexpands the scope of the CCPA. In particular, the CPRA restricts the use of certain categories of sensitive personal information that we handle; establishes\nrestrictions on the retention of personal information; expands the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establishes the California\nPrivacy  Protection  Agency  to  implement  and  enforce  the  CPRA,  as  well  as  impose  administrative  fines.  The  CPRA  provides  for  civil  penalties  for\nviolations,  as  well  as  a  private  right  of  action  for  certain  data  breaches  that  result  in  the  loss  of  personal  information.  This  private  right  of  action  has\nincreased the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation.\n\n39\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##The enactment of the CCPA and CPRA is prompting a wave of similar legislative developments in other states in the United States, which creates the\npotential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. For example, Virginia, Utah, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Tennessee,\nTexas, and Oregon have passed similar laws, which have or will come into force starting in 2023, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation\nin the United States. Other states, such as New York and Massachusetts, have passed specific laws mandating reasonable security measures for the handling\nof personal information. Further, other U.S. states are considering such laws, and there remains increased interest at the federal level.\n\nIn Europe, we are subject to data protection laws such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 and applicable national\nsupplementing laws (\u201cEU GDPR\u201d) and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (\u201cUK GDPR\u201d), (the EU\nGDPR  and  UK  GDPR  together  referred  to  as  the  \u201cGDPR\u201d).  The  GDPR  imposes  comprehensive  compliance  obligations  regarding  our  processing  of\npersonal  information,  including  a  principle  of  transparency,  accountability  and  the  obligation  to  demonstrate  compliance  through  policies,  procedures,\ntraining and audit. Further, the GDPR and UK GDPR regulates cross-border transfers of personal information out of the European Economic Area and the\nUnited  Kingdom.  Case  law  from  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union  (\u201cCJEU\u201d)  states  that  sole  reliance  on  the  standard  contractual  clauses  (a\nstandard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal information transfer mechanism) may not necessarily be sufficient\nin all circumstances and that transfers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. We currently rely on the EU standard contractual clauses and the UK\nAddendum to the EU standard contractual clauses and the UK International Data Transfer Agreement and the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (\u201cDPF\u201d) as\nrelevant  to  transfer  personal  information  outside  the  EEA  and  the  UK,  including  to  the  United  States,  with  respect  to  both  intragroup  and  third  party\ntransfers.  We  expect  the  existing  legal  complexity  and  uncertainty  regarding  international  personal  information  transfers  to  continue,  the  DPF  to  be\nchallenged (continuation of the Schrems case) and international transfers to the United States and to other jurisdictions more generally to continue being\nsubject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny. We could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines; we may have to stop using\ncertain  tools  and  vendors  and  make  other  operational  changes;  we  have  had  to  and  will  have  to  implement  revised  standard  contractual  clauses  and/or\nequivalent transfer mechanisms for intragroup, customer and vendor arrangements within required time frames; and/or the manner in which we provide our\nservices and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are also subject to evolving EEA and UK privacy laws on cookies, tracking technologies and e-marketing. If the trend of increasing enforcement by\nregulators of the strict approach to opt-in consent for all but essential use cases, as seen in recent guidance and decisions, continues, and given the complex\nand evolving nature of EEA and UK privacy laws, this may lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, may lead customers to demand\ncertain standards due to strict privacy laws, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely\naffect our margins, and subject us to additional liabilities and there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our compliance efforts.\n\nThe foregoing laws, regulations, and industry standards may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk,\nrequire additional investment in resources to compliance programs, could impact strategies and availability of previously useful data, and could result in\nincreased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy\npolicies  or  with  any  federal,  state,  or  international  privacy  and  security  laws,  regulations,  industry  standards,  or  other  legal  obligations  relating  to  data\nprivacy and information security could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may result in claims (including class actions), liabilities,\nregulatory investigations, enforcement notices, assessment notices (for a compulsory audit) proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or\nothers, or may require us to change our operations (including by ceasing or changing our data processing activities and applying serious additional controls).\nIn addition, GDPR and similar regulations may cause intensive workloads in privacy offices and related departments in order to meet the related data subject\naccess  rights  and  complaints,  and  if  these  demands  cannot  be  met,  complaints  may  be  filed  to  the  supervisory  authorities  and  ultimately  we  may  face\nsanctions and penalties. Any such claims, proceedings or actions could hurt our reputation, brand and business, force us to incur significant expenses in\ndefense of such proceedings or actions, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, and result in the imposition of monetary penalties.\n\nRisks related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\n\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\n\nCertain  provisions  of  Delaware  law,  our  amended  and  restated  certificate  of  incorporation,  amended  and  restated  bylaws,  and  our  Stockholders\nAgreement dated October 27, 2021 by and among Fluence Energy, LLC, Fluence Energy, Inc., and the Stockholders (as defined therein)(the \u201cStockholders\nAgreement\u201d) may have an antitakeover effect and may delay, defer, or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt, or other change of\ncontrol transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the\nshares held by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things:\n\n\u2022\n\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;\n\n40\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nadvance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;\ncertain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\nthat certain provisions of amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended only by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the\nvoting power represented by our then-outstanding common stock;\nthe right of each of the AES Related Parties, Siemens Related Parties, and the QIA Related Parties (each as defined in the Stockholders Agreement)\nto nominate certain of our directors;\nthe shares of our Class B-1 common stock held by AES entitle them to five votes per share on all matters presented to our stockholders generally;\nand\nthe consent rights of the Continuing Equity Owners in the Stockholders Agreement.\n\nThese antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by\n\nmany of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\n\nIn addition, we have opted out of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which we refer to as the DGCL, but our\namended  and  restated  certificate  of  incorporation  will  provide  that  engaging  in  any  of  a  broad  range  of  business  combinations  with  any  \u201cinterested\u201d\nstockholder (any stockholder with 15% or more of our voting stock) for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an\n\u201cinterested\u201d stockholder is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nBecause we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any\nreturn on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\n\nWe  do  not  anticipate  paying  any  regular  cash  dividends  on  our  Class A  common  stock  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Any  decision  to  declare  and  pay\ndividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, general and economic conditions, our\nresults of operations and financial condition, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and\nregulatory restrictions, and such other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is, and may be, limited\nby covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Therefore, any return on investment in our Class A common stock is\nsolely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our Class A common stock on the open market, which may not occur.\n\nThe dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock. We cannot predict the effect our\nmultiple class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\n\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock, in adverse\npublicity or other adverse consequences. Certain stockholder advisory firms and large institutional investors may prefer companies that do not have multiple\nshare classes or may have investment guidelines that preclude them from investing in companies that have multiple share classes. In addition, certain index\nproviders have previously implemented, and may in the future determine to implement, restrictions on including companies with multiple class share in\ncertain  of  their  indices.  For  example,  from  July  2017  to  April  2023,  S&P  Dow  Jones  excluded  companies  with  multiple  share  classes  from  the  S&P\nComposite 1500 (composed of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600). Indices have discretion to reassess and implement such policies\nwith respect to multi-class differing voting right structures. Under any such policies, our dual class capital structure would make us ineligible for inclusion\nin  any  of  these  indices.  Any  exclusion  from  stock  indices  could  result  in  a  less  active  trading  market  for  our  Class  A  common  stock.  Any  actions  or\npublications by stockholder advisory firms or institutional investors critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely\naffect the value of our Class A common stock.\n\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain\ncorporate governance requirements. You may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such corporate\ngovernance requirements.\n\nOur Continuing Equity Owners have more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors, and, as a result, we are considered a \u201ccontrolled\ncompany\u201d for the purposes of the Nasdaq rules. As such, we qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements,\nincluding the requirements to have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors, an entirely independent compensation committee or to have\ndirector nominations be made, or recommended to the full board of directors, by its independent directors or by a nominations committee that is composed\nentirely of independent directors. The corporate governance requirements and, specifically, the independence standards are intended to ensure directors who\nare considered independent are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors.\n\n41\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Accordingly,  you  may  not  have  the  same  protections  afforded  to  stockholders  of  companies  that  are  subject  to  all  of  the  corporate  governance\nrequirements of the Nasdaq rules. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise\nharm our stock price.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum\nfor certain stockholder litigation matters, and the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any\ncomplaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum\nfor disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides (A) (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any\naction asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Company to the\nCompany  or  the  Company\u2019s  stockholders,  (iii)  any  action  asserting  a  claim  arising  pursuant  to  any  provision  of  the  DGCL,  our  amended  and  restated\ncertificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws (as either may be amended or restated) or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware\nshall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have subject\nmatter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware; and (B) the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive\nforum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive forum\nprovision  shall  not  apply  to  claims  seeking  to  enforce  any  liability  or  duty  created  by  the  Exchange  Act.  The  choice  of  forum  provision  may  limit  a\nstockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may\ndiscourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision\ncontained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated\nwith  resolving  such  action  in  other  jurisdictions,  which  could  harm  our  business,  results  of  operations,  and  financial  condition.  Any  person  or  entity\npurchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our\namended and restated certificate of incorporation.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d does not apply with respect to any director\nor stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries.\n\nThe doctrine of corporate opportunity generally provides that a corporate fiduciary may not develop an opportunity using corporate resources, acquire\nan interest adverse to that of the corporation or acquire property that is reasonably incident to the present or prospective business of the corporation or in\nwhich the corporation has a present or expectancy interest, unless that opportunity is first presented to the corporation and the corporation chooses not to\npursue that opportunity. The doctrine of corporate opportunity is intended to preclude officers or directors or other fiduciaries from personally benefiting\nfrom  opportunities  that  belong  to  the  corporation.  Our  amended  and  restated  certificate  of  incorporation  provides  that  the  doctrine  of  \u201ccorporate\nopportunity\u201d will not apply with respect to any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries. Any director or stockholder who is not\nemployed by us or our subsidiaries, therefore, has no duty to communicate or present corporate opportunities to us, and has the right to either hold any\ncorporate opportunity for their (and their affiliates\u2019) own account and benefit or to recommend, assign or otherwise transfer such corporate opportunity to\npersons other than us, including to any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries.\n\nAs a result, certain of our stockholders, directors, and their respective affiliates, including AES Grid Stability, LLC, Siemens AG, Siemens Pension-\nTrust e.V., QHL, and any of our directors nominated by them that are not employed by us or our subsidiaries, are not prohibited from operating or investing\nin competing businesses. We, therefore, may find ourselves in competition with certain of our stockholders, directors, or their respective affiliates, and we\nmay not have knowledge of, or be able to pursue, transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly, we may lose a corporate opportunity or\nsuffer competitive harm, which could negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nYou may be diluted by future issuances of additional Class A common stock or common units in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or\notherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price.\n\nThe sale of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market\nprice of shares of our Class A common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity\nsecurities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had outstanding a total of 118,903,435 shares of Class A common stock. Of the outstanding shares, 41,823,465 shares\n\nheld by public investors are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, other\n\n42\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##than any shares held by our affiliates. Any shares of Class A common stock held by our affiliates will be eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the\nSecurities Act, subject to the volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144.\n\nIn addition, we, Fluence Energy, LLC and the Founders are party to the Fluence Energy, LLC Agreement under which Founders (or certain permitted\ntransferees thereof) were granted the right (subject to the terms of the Fluence Energy, LLC Agreement) to have their common units redeemed from time to\ntime at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within the meaning of the rules of the Nasdaq) who are disinterested), newly-issued\nshares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment from the sale of newly issued shares of Class A common stock equal to a\nvolume weighted average market price of one share of Class A common stock for each common unit so redeemed, in each case, in accordance with the\nterms of the Fluence Energy, LLC Agreement; provided that, at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within the meaning of the\nrules of the Nasdaq) who are disinterested), we may effect a direct exchange by us of such Class A common stock or such cash, as applicable, for such\ncommon units. The Founders may exercise such redemption right, subject to certain exceptions, for as long as their common units remain outstanding. For\nexample, in July 2022, Siemens Industry exercised its redemption right with respect to its entire holding of 58,586,695 common units, which we elected to\nsettle through the issuance of 58,586,695 shares of Class A common stock. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decline as a\nresult of these redemptions or exchanges or the perception that a redemption or exchange could occur. These redemptions or exchanges, or the possibility\nthat these redemptions or exchanges may occur, also might make it more difficult for holders of our Class A common stock to sell such stock in the future at\na time and at a price that they deem appropriate.\n\nIn addition, we have outstanding options to acquire shares of Class A common stock pursuant to equity incentive awards issued pursuant to the 2020\nUnit Option Plan of Fluence Energy, LLC (the \u201cExisting Equity Plan\u201d). Further, we have outstanding phantom shares conveying the right to receive cash or\nequity based upon the value of Class A common stock. Finally, we have reserved 9,500,000 shares of Class A common stock for issuance under the Fluence\nEnergy, Inc. 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the \u201c2021 Equity Plan\u201d). Any Class A common stock that we issue under the 2021 Equity Plan or other equity\nincentive plans that we may adopt in the future would be dilutive to Class A common stockholders.\n\nIn the future, we may also issue securities in connection with investments, acquisitions or capital raising activities, which could constitute a material\nportion of our then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock. Further in connection with the completion of the IPO, we entered into a Registration\nRights Agreement with certain of the Continuing Equity Owners. Any such issuance of additional securities or any exercise of registration rights or the\nprospect of any such sales, could materially impact the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through\nfuture sales of equity securities.\n\nRisks Related to Our Existing Shareholders\n\nOur certificate of incorporation limit our Continuing Equity Owners\u2019 and their directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability to us or you for breach of fiduciary duty\nand could also prevent us from benefiting from corporate opportunities that might otherwise have been available to us.\n\nOur  certificate  of  incorporation  provides  that,  subject  to  any  contractual  provision  to  the  contrary,  our  Continuing  Equity  Owners  will  have  no\n\nobligation to refrain from:\n\ndoing business with any of our clients, customers, vendors or lessors;\n\nengaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as we do;\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 making investments in any property in which we may make investments.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, neither Continuing Equity Owners nor any officer or director of Continuing Equity Owners, except as provided\n\nemploying or otherwise engaging any of our officers or employees; or\n\nin our certificate of incorporation, will be liable to us or to our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any of these activities.\n\nAny interests or expectancy in corporate opportunities which become known to (i) any of our directors or officers who are also directors, officers,\nemployees or other affiliates of Continuing Equity Owners or their affiliates (except that we and our subsidiaries shall not be deemed affiliates of Continuing\nEquity Owners or its affiliates for the purposes of the provision), or dual persons, or (ii) our Continuing Equity Owners themselves, and which relate to the\nbusiness of Fluence or may constitute a corporate opportunity for both our Continuing Equity Owners and us. Generally, neither our Continuing Equity\nOwners nor our directors or officers who are also dual persons will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact\nthat any such person pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for the account of our Continuing Equity Owners or their affiliates, directs,\n\n43\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##recommends, sells, assigns or otherwise transfers such corporate opportunity to Our Continuing Equity Owners or its affiliates, or does not communicate\ninformation regarding such corporate opportunity to us. The corporate opportunity provision may exacerbate conflicts of interest between our Continuing\nEquity Owners and us because the provision effectively permits one of our directors or officers who also serves as a director, officer, employee, or other\naffiliate of Our Continuing Equity Owners to choose to direct a corporate opportunity to our Continuing Equity Owners instead of us.\n\nOur Continuing Equity Owners are not restricted from competing with us in the energy storage business, including as a result of acquiring a company\nthat operates an energy storage business. Due to the significant resources of our Continuing Equity Owners, including their intellectual property (all of\nwhich our Continuing Equity Owners retain and certain of which they license to us under applicable intellectual property license agreements), financial\nresources,  name  recognition  and  know-how  resulting  from  the  previous  management  of  our  business,  our  Continuing  Equity  Owners  could  have  a\nsignificant competitive advantage over us should any of them decide to utilize these resources to engage in the type of business we conduct, which may in\nturn cause our operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe are controlled by the Continuing Equity Owners, whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the Continuing Equity Owners control approximately 89.8% of the combined voting power of our common stock\nthrough their ownership of both Class A common stock and Class B-1 common stock. The Continuing Equity Owners have the ability to substantially\ninfluence us through their ownership position over corporate management and affairs. The Continuing Equity Owners are able to, subject to applicable law,\nand the voting arrangements, elect a majority of the members of our board of directors and control actions to be taken by us and our board of directors,\nincluding  amendments  to  our  certificate  of  incorporation  and  bylaws  and  approval  of  significant  corporate  transactions,  including  mergers  and  sales  of\nsubstantially all of our assets. The directors so elected will have the authority, subject to the terms of our indebtedness and applicable rules and regulations,\nto  issue  additional  stock,  implement  stock  repurchase  programs,  declare  dividends  and  make  other  decisions.  It  is  possible  that  the  interests  of  the\nContinuing Equity Owners may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders, including you. For example,\nthe Continuing Equity Owners may have different tax positions from us, especially in light of the Tax Receivable Agreement, that could influence our\ndecisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, and whether and when we\nshould terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate its obligations thereunder. In addition, the determination of future tax reporting positions and\nthe structuring of future transactions may take into consideration the Continuing Equity Owners\u2019 tax or other considerations, which may differ from the\nconsiderations of us or our other stockholders.\n\nCertain of our officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with our Continuing Equity Owners.\n\nRicardo Falu, Tish Mendoza, Barbara Humpton, Emma Falck, Axel Meier, Chris Shelton and Simon Smith serve on our board of directors and are\nemployed by and have retained their positions with AES, Siemens, or QIA or any of their respective affiliates, as applicable. These individuals\u2019 holdings in\nand compensation from the relevant Continuing Equity Owners may be significant for some of these persons. Their positions at AES, Siemens, or QIA or\ntheir respective affiliates, their compensation from AES, Siemens or QIA or their respective affiliates and the ownership of any equity or equity awards in\nAES, Siemens, or QIA or their respective affiliates, as applicable, may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with\ndecisions that could have different implications for our Continuing Equity Owners than the decisions have for us.\n\nWe rely on our access to our Founders\u2019 brands and reputation for establishing and building relationships with customers.\n\nWe believe the association with our Founders has previously contributed and continues to contribute to our establishing and building relationships with\nour customers due to the Founders\u2019 recognized brands and products, as well as resources such as their intellectual property and access to other third parties\u2019\nintellectual  property.  Any  perceived  loss  of  our  Founders\u2019  scale,  capital  base  and  financial  strength,  or  any  actual  loss  or  reduction  in  the  Founders\u2019\nownership of the Company in the future, may prompt business partners to reprice, modify or terminate their relationships with us. In addition, our Founders\u2019\nreduction of their ownership of our company may cause some of our existing agreements and licenses to be terminated.\n\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for liabilities of our Founders, which could result in a decrease in our income.\n\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for our Founders\u2019 liabilities. If those liabilities are significant and we are ultimately held liable for them,\n\nwe cannot assure that we will be able to recover the full amount of our losses from our Founders.\n\nWe may be required to pay additional taxes as a result of partnership tax audit rules.\n\nWe may be required to pay additional taxes as a result of partnership audit rules under U.S. federal and other applicable income tax law. The Bipartisan\nBudget Act of 2015 changed the rules applicable to U.S. federal income tax audits of partnerships, including entities such as Fluence Energy, LLC. Under\nthese rules (which generally are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,\n\n44\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##2017), subject to certain exceptions, audit adjustments to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of an entity (and any holder\u2019s share thereof) are\ndetermined, and taxes, interest, and penalties attributable thereto, are assessed and collected, at the partnership level. It is possible that they could result in\nFluence Energy, LLC (or any of its subsidiaries that are or have been treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) being required to pay\nadditional taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment, and we, as an owner of Fluence Energy, LLC (or as an indirect owner of such other\nentities), could be required to indirectly bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and penalties even if they relate to periods prior to the IPO and\neven though we may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes as a result of the related audit adjustment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\n\nOur principal asset is our interest in Fluence Energy, LLC, and, as a result, we depend on distributions from Fluence Energy, LLC to pay our taxes and\nexpenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Fluence Energy, LLC\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various\nlimitations and restrictions.\n\nWe  are  a  holding  company  and  have  no  material  assets  other  than  our  ownership  of  LLC  Interests.  As  such,  we  have  no  independent  means  of\ngenerating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future, if any, are dependent\nupon the financial results and cash flows of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from Fluence Energy, LLC. There can be\nno  assurance  that  Fluence  Energy,  LLC  and  its  subsidiaries  will  generate  sufficient  cash  flow  to  distribute  funds  to  us  or  that  applicable  state  law  and\ncontractual restrictions, including negative covenants in our debt instruments, will permit such distributions. The ABL Credit Agreement limits, and our\nfuture debt agreements may similarly limit, our ability to make certain payments, including dividends and distributions on Fluence Energy, LLC\u2019s equity,\nFluence Energy, Inc.\u2019s equity and other restricted payments.\n\nFluence Energy, LLC continues to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally is not subject to any entity-\nlevel U.S. federal income tax. Instead, any taxable income of Fluence Energy, LLC will be allocated to holders of LLC Interests, including us. Accordingly,\nwe incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of Fluence Energy, LLC. We expect to use distributions from Fluence Energy, LLC\nto fund any payments that we are required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Under the terms of the Fluence Energy LLC Agreement, Fluence\nEnergy, LLC is obligated, subject to various limitations and restrictions, including with respect to our debt agreements, to make tax distributions to holders\nof LLC Interests, including us, although tax distributions may not be paid in whole or in part in certain circumstances, including if Fluence Energy, LLC\ndoes  not  have  available  cash  to  make  such  distributions.  In  addition  to  tax  expenses,  we  will  also  incur  expenses  related  to  our  operations,  including\npayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which we expect could be significant. We intend, as its managing member, to cause Fluence Energy, LLC to\nmake cash distributions to the holders of LLC Interests in an amount sufficient to (1) fund all or part of their tax obligations in respect of taxable income\nallocated to them and (2) cover our operating expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, Fluence Energy, LLC\u2019s ability\nto make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or\nagreement to which Fluence Energy, LLC is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering\nFluence Energy, LLC insolvent. If we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities, or to fund our operations (including, if applicable, as a\nresult of an acceleration of our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement), we may have to borrow funds, which could materially and adversely\naffect our liquidity and financial condition, and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any lenders of such funds. To the extent we are unable to make\ntimely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided,\nhowever, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting in\nthe  acceleration  of  payments  due  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement.  In  addition,  if  Fluence  Energy,  LLC  does  not  have  sufficient  funds  to  make\ndistributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends will also be restricted or impaired. See \u201c\u2014Risks related to ownership of our Class A common\nstock\u201d.\n\n45\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##As a result of (1) potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and to Fluence Energy, LLC\u2019s other equity holders, (2) the\nlower tax rate applicable to corporations as opposed to individuals, and (3) certain tax benefits that we anticipate from (a) future redemptions or exchanges\nof LLC Interests from the Founders, (b) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and (c) certain other transactions, tax distributions to us may be in\namounts that exceed our tax liabilities. Our board of directors will determine the appropriate uses for any excess cash so accumulated, which may include,\namong other uses, the payment of obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash)\nto our stockholders. No adjustments to the redemption or exchange ratio or price for LLC Interests and corresponding shares of Class B-1 or Class B-2\ncommon stock will be made as a result of any cash distribution by us or any retention of cash by us. To the extent we do not distribute such excess cash as\ndividends on our Class A common stock, we may take other actions with respect to such excess cash, for example, holding such excess cash, or lending it\n(or a portion thereof) to Fluence Energy, LLC or its subsidiaries, which may result in shares of our Class A common stock increasing in value relative to the\nvalue of LLC Interests. The holders of LLC Interests may benefit from any value attributable to such cash balances or loan receivables if they acquire shares\nof Class A common stock in exchange for their LLC Interests or otherwise exercise their rights to redeem or exchange their LLC Interests, notwithstanding\nthat such holders may have participated previously as holders of LLC Interests in distributions by Fluence Energy, LLC that resulted in the excess cash\nbalances.\n\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement with the Founders requires us to make cash payments to them in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become\nentitled, and we expect that such payments will be substantial.\n\nWe are party to a Tax Receivable Agreement with Fluence Energy, LLC and the Founders. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are required to\nmake cash payments to such Founders equal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize, as\na result of (1) the increases in our share of the tax basis of assets of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries resulting from any redemptions or exchanges\nof LLC Interests from the Founders and certain distributions (or deemed distributions) by Fluence Energy, LLC; and (2) certain other tax benefits arising\nfrom payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For example, the Siemens Redemption with respect to its entire holding of 58,586,695 common units\nof Fluence Energy, LLC, resulted in increases in the tax basis of the assets of Fluence Energy, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries. As a result of the tax basis\nadjustment,  the  Siemens  Redemption  will  result  in  future  tax  savings  of  $96.5  million.  Siemens  will  be  entitled  to  receive  payments  under  the  Tax\nReceivable Agreement equaling 85% of such amount, or $82.0 million; assuming, among other factors, (i) we will have sufficient taxable income to fully\nutilize the tax benefits; (ii) Fluence Energy, LLC is able to fully depreciate or amortize its assets; and (iii) no material changes in applicable tax law. We\nanticipate funding ordinary course payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement from cash flow from operations of our subsidiaries, available cash or\navailable  borrowings  under  any  future  debt  agreements.  We  expect  that  the  amount  of  the  cash  payments  we  will  be  required  to  make  under  the  Tax\nReceivable  Agreement  will  be  substantial.  Any  payments  made  by  us  to  the  Founders  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  will  not  be  available  for\nreinvestment in our business and will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us and have a substantial\nnegative impact on our liquidity. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid\namounts generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material\nbreach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting in the acceleration of payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The\npayments  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  are  not  conditioned  upon  continued  ownership  of  us  by  the  redeeming  or  exchanging  Founders.\nFurthermore,  our  future  obligation  to  make  payments  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  could  make  us  a  less  attractive  target  for  an  acquisition,\nparticularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement. The actual\nincrease in tax basis, and the actual utilization of any resulting tax benefits, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors: including the timing of redemptions of exchanges by the Founders; the price of shares of our\nClass A common stock at the time of the exchange; the extent to which such redemptions or exchanges are taxable; the amount of gain recognized by such\nFounders; the amount and timing of the taxable income allocated to us or otherwise generated by us in the future; the portion of our payments under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement constituting imputed interest; and the federal and state tax rates then applicable.\n\nOur organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the Founders that will not benefit holders of our\nClass A common stock to the same extent that it will benefit the Founders.\n\nOur organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the Founders that will not benefit the holders of\nour Class A common stock to the same extent that it will benefit such Founders. We are party to the Tax Receivable Agreement with Fluence Energy, LLC\nand certain Founders, which provides for the payment by us to such Founders of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in\nsome circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (1) the increases in our share of the tax basis of assets of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries\nresulting from any future redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests from the Founders and certain distributions (or deemed distributions) by Fluence\nEnergy, LLC and (2) certain other tax benefits arising from payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Although we will retain 15% of the amount of\nsuch tax benefits, this and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the future trading market for the Class A common stock.\n\n46\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated or significantly exceed any actual benefits we realize in respect of\nthe tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if (1) we materially breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and the\nFounders  elect  an  early  termination  of  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement,  (2)  certain  mergers,  asset  sales,  other  forms  of  business  combinations  or  other\nchanges of control were to occur after the consummation of the IPO and the Founders elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, or (3) we\nelect, at any time, an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then our obligations, or our successor\u2019s obligations, under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement to make payments would be based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize\nall potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits\nthat are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, based on certain assumptions, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual\nrealization,  if  any,  of  such  future  tax  benefits.  We  could  also  be  required  to  make  cash  payments  to  the  Founders  that  are  greater  than  the\nspecified percentage of any actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. In these\nsituations,  our  obligations  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  could  have  a  substantial  negative  impact  on  our  liquidity  and  could  have  the  effect  of\ndelaying, deferring, or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. There can be no assurance\nthat we will be able to fund or finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent we are unable to make timely payments under the\nTax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment\nfor  a  specified  period  may  constitute  a  material  breach  of  a  material  obligation  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  resulting  in  the  acceleration  of\npayments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our\ncash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.\n\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\n\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service,\nor the IRS, or another tax authority, may challenge all or part of the tax basis increases or other tax benefits we claim, as well as other related tax positions\nwe take, and a court could sustain such challenge. If the outcome of any audit of us or our subsidiaries is reasonably expected to adversely affect the rights\nand obligations of the Founders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in a material respect, then we will notify the Founders of such audit, keep them\nreasonably informed with respect thereto, provide them with a reasonable opportunity to provide information and other input concerning the audit or the\nrelevant portion thereof and consider such information and other input in good faith. The interests of such Founders in any such challenge may differ from\nor  conflict  with  our  interests  and  your  interests,  and  the  Founders  may  exercise  their  rights  relating  to  any  such  challenge  in  a  manner  adverse  to  our\ninterests and your interests. We will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any\ntax benefits initially claimed by us and for which payment has been made are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed.\nInstead, any excess cash payments made by us will be netted against any future cash payments we might otherwise be required to make to the applicable\nFounder under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to a\nFounder for a number of years following the initial time of such payment and, if any of our tax reporting positions are challenged by a taxing authority, we\nwill not be permitted to reduce any future cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement until any such challenge is finally settled or determined.\nMoreover, the excess cash payments we made previously under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be greater than the amount of future cash payments\nagainst which we would otherwise be permitted to net such excess. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules for determining applicable tax benefits we\nmay claim are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions. As a\nresult, payments could be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement significantly in excess of any actual cash tax savings that we realize in respect of the\ntax attributes that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect\nour results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  taxes  by  the  U.S.  federal,  state,  local,  and  foreign  tax  authorities.  Our  future  effective  tax  rates  could  be  subject  to  volatility  or\n\nadversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nallocation of expenses to and among different jurisdictions;\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\n47\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\nchanges in tax laws, tax treaties, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\nlower  than  anticipated  future  earnings  in  jurisdictions  where  we  have  lower  statutory  tax  rates  and  higher  than  anticipated  future  earnings  in\njurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\n\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other taxes by U.S. federal, state, and local, and foreign taxing authorities. Outcomes\n\nfrom these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\n\nIf we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act, including as a result of our\nownership of Fluence Energy, LLC, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\n\nUnder Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d for purposes of the 1940 Act if\n(1) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, or\n(2) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire\ninvestment  securities  having  a  value  exceeding  40%  of  the  value  of  its  total  assets  (exclusive  of  U.S.  government  securities  and  cash  items)  on  an\nunconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an \u201cinvestment company,\u201d as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.\n\nWe and Fluence Energy, LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. As the sole managing member of\nFluence  Energy,  LLC,  we  will  control  and  operate  Fluence  Energy,  LLC.  On  that  basis,  we  believe  that  our  interest  in  Fluence  Energy,  LLC  is  not  an\n\u201cinvestment security\u201d as that term is used in the 1940 Act. However, if we were to cease participation in the management of Fluence Energy, LLC, or if\nFluence Energy, LLC itself becomes an investment company, our interest in Fluence Energy, LLC could be deemed an \u201cinvestment security\u201d for purposes of\nthe 1940 Act.\n\nWe and Fluence Energy, LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. If it were established that we\nwere an unregistered investment company, there would be a risk that we would be subject to monetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by\nthe SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties and that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions undertaken\nduring the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company. If we were required to register as an investment company, restrictions\nimposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue\nour business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\nAs a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these\ninternal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common\nstock.\n\nWe  are  a  public  reporting  company  subject  to  the  rules  and  regulations  established  from  time  to  time  by  the  SEC  and  Nasdaq.  These  rules  and\nregulations require, among other things, that we have and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. The\nprocess of designing and implementing internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this requirement is time-consuming, costly, and\ncomplicated.\n\nUnder Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act our management is required to assess and report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control\nover financial reporting and to identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of no longer qualifying as an\n\u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 and becoming a large accelerated filer, we are also required to\ncomply with, among other requirements, the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b). If during the evaluation and testing process we identify one\nor  more  other  material  weaknesses  in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  or  determine  that  existing  material  weaknesses  have  not  been  fully\nremediated, our management will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In addition, if we fail to achieve and\nmaintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented, or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure\nthat we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act.\n\nAs discussed in \u201cItem 9A \u2013 Controls and Procedures \u2013 Management\u2019s Report in Internal Control over Financial Reporting,\u201d as of September 30, 2022,\n\nwe previously reported a material weakness in internal control over revenue recognition and related inventory.\n\n48\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##As of September 30, 2023, the material weakness in internal control over revenue recognition has not fully been remediated. The Company\u2019s controls\nrelated to its estimate at completion (\u201cEAC\u201d), which is used in the Company\u2019s percentage of completion (\u201cPOC\u201d) accounting for its battery energy storage\nsolutions were not effective.\n\nWe assessed the material weakness as not remediated as the EAC controls did not consistently operate for a sufficient period of time and due to control\noperating effectiveness issues identified in management\u2019s assessment of controls. Certain aspects of the prior year material weakness have been successfully\nremediated as it relates to inventory and liquidated damages. We are actively engaged in implementing a remediation plan to address the material weakness.\nThe material weakness will not be considered fully remediated until management designs and implements effective controls that operate for a sufficient\nperiod of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective.\n\nWe cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing, and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations.\nIf  we  are  not  able  to  implement  the  requirements  of  Section  404  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  in  a  timely  manner  or  with  adequate  compliance,  our\nindependent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse opinion due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting, and we may be\nsubject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Nasdaq or SEC. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial\nmarkets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal\ncontrol system and the hiring of additional personnel. Any such action could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\n\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings, regulatory disputes, and governmental inquiries that could cause us to incur significant\nexpenses, divert our management\u2019s attention, and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe have been and continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other regulatory or legal proceedings that arise out of our\noperations  and  business  and  that  cover  a  wide  range  of  matters,  including,  among  others,  intellectual  property  matters,  labor  and  employment  claims,\npersonal injury claims, product liability claims, contract disputes, and warranty claims. In addition, since our energy storage products are new types of\nproducts in a nascent market, we have in the past needed and may in the future need to seek the amendment of existing regulations or, in some cases, the\ncreation of new regulations, in order to operate our business in some jurisdictions. Such regulatory processes may require public hearings concerning our\nbusiness,  which  could  expose  us  to  subsequent  litigation.  Litigation  and  regulatory  proceedings  may  be  protracted  and  expensive,  and  may  divert\nmanagement attention and resources and the ultimate results may be difficult to predict. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. Any of these actions could expose us to adverse publicity that could harm our reputation and operations. Unfavorable\noutcomes  or  developments  relating  to  proceedings  to  which  we  are  a  party  or  transactions  involving  our  products  and  services,  such  as  judgments  for\nmonetary damages, injunctions, or denial or revocation of permits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. In addition, settlement of claims could adversely also affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nChanges in accounting principles or their application to us could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, which could adversely affect our\noperating results and prospects.\n\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accounting for our business is\nsubject  to  change  based  on  the  evolution  of  our  business  model,  interpretations  of  relevant  accounting  principles,  enforcement  of  existing  or  new\nregulations, and changes in policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting and financial reporting requirements of the SEC or other regulatory\nagencies. A change in any of these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations or application to us, may have a significant effect on our reported\nresults, as well as our processes and related controls, and may retroactively affect previously reported results, which may negatively impact our financial\nstatements, which may in turn adversely affect our prospects. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles and accounting\npolicies  over  financial  reporting,  any  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  and  could  require  significant\ninvestment in systems and personnel.\n\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating\nresults could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market\nprice of our common stock.\n\nThe  preparation  of  our  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  requires  us  to  make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base estimates and assumptions on historical experience and\non various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the\ncarrying  values  of  assets,  liabilities,  equity,  revenue  and  expenses  that  are  not  readily  apparent  from  other  sources.  We  may  make  estimates  regarding\nactivities  for  which  the  accounting  treatment  is  still  uncertain.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates.  If  our  assumptions  change  or  if  actual\ncircumstances differ\n\n49\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##from  our  assumptions,  our  operating  results  may  be  adversely  affected  and  could  fall  below  our  publicly  announced  guidance  or  the  expectations  of\nsecurities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.\n\nITEM 1B.

Our Erlangen office includes an energy\nstorage testing facility.\n\nIn  addition  to  our  office  and  co-working  spaces,  we  also  lease  operational  facilities  in  Toole,  Utah,  Kingman,  Arizona,  Rockville,  Maryland,  East\nHuntingdon  Township,  Pennsylvania,  and  Long  Beach,  California.  These  facilities  are  primarily  for  product  staging  and  storage  and  research  and\ndevelopment activities.\n\nWe believe that our existing properties are in good condition and are sufficient and suitable for the conduct of our business for the foreseeable future. To\n\nthe extent our needs change as our business grows, we expect that additional space and facilities will be available.\n\nWe have gone through rigorous certification processes at several of our offices and are actively pursuing additional certification at others. The corporate\noffice space in Arlington is ISO 9001 and ISO 45001 certified and the testing facility in Erlangen is ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 45001 certified (quality,\nenvironmental and safety certifications, respectively). Our Melbourne office is ISO 9001 certified and ISO 45001, and our U.S. Arlington office is SA8000\ncertified which is a standard of ethical and decent working conditions.\n\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims that arise out of our operations and businesses and that cover a wide range of\nmatters,  including,  among  others,  intellectual  property  matters,  contract  disputes,  insurance  and  property  damage  claims,  employment  claims,  personal\ninjury claims, product liability claims, environmental claims and warranty claims. Currently, there are no claims or proceedings against us that we believe\nwill have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the results of any current or future\nlitigation  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty,  and  regardless  of  the  outcome,  we  may  incur  significant  costs  and  experience  a  diversion  of  management\nresources as a result of claims and litigation.\n\nFor  a  description  of  our  material  pending  legal  contingencies,  please  see  Note  14  -  Commitments and Contingencies,  to  the  consolidated  financial\n\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\nITEM 4.

MARKET  FOR  REGISTRANT\u2019S  COMMON  EQUITY,  RELATED  STOCKHOLDER  MATTERS  AND  ISSUER  PURCHASES  OF\nEQUITY SECURITIES\n\nPART II\n\nMarket Information\n\nOur Class A common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cFLNC\u201d since October 28, 2021. Prior to that date,\n\nthere was no public market for our Class A common stock.\n\nOur Class B-1 common stock and Class B-2 common stock are not traded in any public market.\n\nHolders\n\nAs of November 20, 2023, there was one holder of our Class B-1 common stock, no holders of our Class B-2 common stock, and approximately 630\nstockholders of record of our Class A common stock, although we believe that because many of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock are held in\naccounts with brokers and other institutions, we have more beneficial owners.\n\nDividends\n\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund\nthe development and growth of our business, and therefore we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the\nforeseeable future. Holders of our Class B-1 and Class B-2 common stock are not entitled to participate in any dividends declared by our board of directors.\n\nFurthermore,  because  we  are  a  holding  company,  our  ability  to  pay  cash  dividends  on  our  Class  A  common  stock  depends  on  our  receipt  of  cash\ndistributions from Fluence Energy, LLC and, through Fluence Energy, LLC, cash distributions and dividends from our other direct and indirect subsidiaries.\n\nAssuming Fluence Energy, LLC makes distributions out of earnings and profits (other than tax distributions and other distributions to pay expenses) to\nits members in any given year, we currently expect, subject to the determination of our board of directors, to pay dividends on our Class A common stock\nout of the portion of such distributions remaining after our payment of taxes, Tax Receivable Agreement payments and expenses, and subject to Delaware\nlaw. Our ability to pay dividends was previously restricted by our Revolving Credit Agreement, dated November 1, 2021, which was terminated effective\nNovember 22, 2023, and is currently restricted under our ABL Credit Agreement, dated November 22, 2023, and may similarly be restricted by the terms of\nany future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of us or our subsidiaries. Any future determination as to the declaration and\npayment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to compliance with contractual restrictions and covenants in the\nagreements  governing  our  future  indebtedness.  Any  such  determination  will  also  depend  upon  our  business  prospects,  results  of  operations,  financial\ncondition, cash requirements and availability and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\n\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\n\nInformation regarding securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans is incorporated herein by reference to Item 12, \u201cSecurity\n\nOwnership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\u201d of Part III of this Annual Report.\n\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities\n\nThere were no unregistered sales of our equity securities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, that were not otherwise disclosed in a\n\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q or a Current Report on Form 8-K.\n\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\nNone.\n\n51\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Performance Graph\n\nThe following graph compares the total stockholder return from October 28, 2021, the date on which our Class A common stock commenced trading on\nthe Nasdaq Global Select Market through September 30, 2023 of (i) our Class A common stock, (ii) the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund\n(QCLN), and (iii) the NASDAQ Composite Index.

Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any periods in the future.\n\nUpon the completion of our initial public offering (the \u201cIPO\u201d) and a series of organization transactions (collectively with the IPO, the \u201cTransactions\u201d)\non November 1, 2021, Fluence Energy, Inc. became a holding company whose sole material assets are the limited liability interests in Fluence Energy, LLC\n(the \u201cLLC Interests\u201d). All of our business is conducted through Fluence Energy, LLC, together with its subsidiaries, and the financial results of Fluence\nEnergy,  LLC  are  consolidated  in  our  financial  statements.  Except  where  the  context  clearly  indicates  otherwise,  \u201cFluence,\u201d  \u201cwe,\u201d  \u201cus,\u201d  \u201cour\u201d  or  the\n\u201cCompany\u201d refers to Fluence Energy, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\n\nOur fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. References to \u201cfiscal year 2021\u201d, \u201cfiscal year 2022\u201d and \u201cfiscal year 2023\u201d refer to the\n\nfiscal years ended September 30, 2021, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nPresentation of Financial Information\n\nFluence Energy, LLC is the accounting predecessor of Fluence Energy, Inc. for financial reporting purposes. Fluence Energy, Inc. will be the audited\n\nfinancial reporting entity for future filings. Accordingly, this Annual Report contains the following historical financial statements:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nFluence Energy, Inc. The historical financial information of Fluence Energy, Inc. has not been included in this Annual Report prior to the IPO as it\nwas  a  newly  incorporated  entity,  had  no  business  transactions  or  activities  prior  to  the  IPO  and  had  no  assets  or  liabilities  during  the  periods\npresented prior to the IPO.\nFluence  Energy,  LLC.  Because  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  has  no  interest  in  any  operations  other  than  those  of  Fluence  Energy,  LLC  and  its\nsubsidiaries, the historical consolidated financial information included in this Annual Report is that of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries.\n\nSiemens Industry Redemption\n\nOn June 30, 2022, Siemens Industry, Inc. exercised its redemption right pursuant to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability\nCompany Agreement of Fluence Energy, LLC (the \u201cLLC Agreement\u201d) with respect to its entire holding of 58,586,695 LLC Interests of Fluence Energy,\nLLC,  together  with  the  corresponding  cancellation  of  an  equivalent  number  of  shares  of  Class  B-1  common  stock  of  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.,  par  value\n$0.00001 per share (the \u201cSiemens Redemption\u201d).\n\nThe  Company  elected  to  settle  the  Siemens  Redemption  through  the  issuance  of  58,586,695  shares  of  the  Company\u2019s  Class  A  common  stock  (the\n\u201cShares\u201d). The Siemens Redemption settled on July 7, 2022. Siemens Industry, Inc. effected an internal transfer of its interest in the Shares to Siemens AG\nat the time of Siemens Redemption and as of June 30, 2022, Siemens AG became the beneficial owner of 58,586,695 shares of Class A common stock. The\nSiemens Redemption increased the beneficial ownership interest of the Company in Fluence Energy, LLC to 66.08% as of June 30, 2022. The impact of the\nchange in ownership interest did not result in a change in control. The Siemens Redemption has been accounted for as an equity transaction and the carrying\namount of non-controlling interest has been adjusted.\n\nSubsequent to the Siemens Redemption, on September 29, 2022, Siemens AG effected an internal transfer of 18,848,631 shares of Class A common\nstock to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V., an affiliated entity and a permitted transferee under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement dated October 27, 2021,\nby and among Fluence Energy, LLC, Fluence Energy, Inc., and the Stockholders (as defined therein)(the \u201cStockholders Agreement\u201d).\n\nSegments\n\nThe Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company\u2019s CODM reviews financial information on a\nconsolidated  basis  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions,  allocating  resources,  and  evaluating  financial  performance.  As  such,  the  Company  has\ndetermined that it operates in one operating segment, which corresponds to one reportable segment.\n\n53\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Negotiations with our Largest Battery Module Vendor\n\nIn December 2021, we entered negotiations with our largest battery module vendor to amend our battery supply agreement. As part of the discussions,\nthe vendor sought to renegotiate the price we were to pay for battery modules purchased in calendar year 2022 as well as those expected to be purchased\nduring the remainder of calendar year 2022 and calendar year 2023. As part of these negotiations, we also discussed settlement of contractual claims by\nFluence to the vendor. These negotiations continued throughout calendar year 2022. On December 15, 2022, we finalized an agreement with the vendor,\namending the supply agreement and resolving our claims. The amendments and settlement were consistent with what we had estimated and disclosed in our\n2022 consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission on December 14, 2022 (the \u201c2022 Annual Report\u201d). As part of the finalized agreement, we agreed to take on an additional scope of\nwork related to commissioning the battery modules installed. The approximately $19.5 million settlement for our claims was recognized as a reduction of\ncosts of goods and services for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n\n2021 Cargo Loss Incident\n\nOn April 28, 2021, the Company was notified of an emergency aboard a vessel carrying Fluence inventory. This incident (the \u201cCargo Loss Incident\u201d)\nresulted in damage to a portion of our cargo aboard the vessel. The Company recorded $13.0 million provision to its inventory as of September 30, 2021,\nbased on the net realizable value of cargo that was destroyed. During fiscal year 2022, $13.0 million of inventory was written off against the provision. In\naddition to the inventory losses, we incurred incremental expenses related to the incident, primarily consisting of inspection costs, project cost overruns due\nto logistical changes, legal fees, fees to dispose of the damaged cargo, and additional cost to replace the damaged cargo. We received an aggregate of $10.0\nmillion in insurance proceeds related to non-disputed claims, $7.5 million of which was collected in October 2021 and the remaining $2.5 million was\ncollected in April 2022. As of September 30, 2023, we expect to continue to incur legal fees as plaintiff in the pending matter relating to this incident.\n\n2021 Overheating Event at Customer Facility\n\nOn September 4, 2021, a 300 MW energy storage facility owned by one of our customers experienced an overheating event. Fluence served as the\nenergy storage technology provider and designed and installed portions of the facility, which was completed in fiscal year 2021. No injuries were reported\nfrom the incident. The facility was taken offline as teams from Fluence, our customer, and the battery designer/manufacturer investigated the incident. Our\ncustomer released initial findings in the second fiscal quarter of 2022 on what it contends is the root cause of the incident. At this time, Fluence cannot\ncomment on or accept the customer\u2019s stated findings. The customer\u2019s stated findings, if ultimately confirmed and proven, could relate to certain scopes of\nwork for which Fluence or its subcontractors could be responsible. The customer\u2019s stated findings, however, could also relate to certain scopes of work for\nwhich other parties were responsible and/or relate to other causes, including the design and installation of portions of the facility over which Fluence did not\nhave responsibility or control. The customer has alleged that Fluence is liable for the incident but has not yet demanded a specific amount of compensation\nnor alleged a particular level of responsibility. Fluence has denied liability. No formal legal proceedings have been commenced, but it is reasonably possible\nthat  litigation  may  result  from  this  matter  if  a  resolution  cannot  be  achieved.  Any  such  dispute  would  also  likely  include  claims  by  Fluence  and\ncounterclaims by the customer relating to disputed costs arising from the original design and construction of the facility. The customer announced in July of\n2022 that a large portion of the facility was back online. We are currently not able to estimate the impact, that this incident may have on our financial results.\nTo date, we do not believe that this incident has impacted the market\u2019s adoption of our energy storage products and solutions.\n\n2022 Overheating Event at Customer Facility\n\nOn April 18, 2022, a 10 MW energy storage facility in Chandler, Arizona owned by AES experienced an overheating event. Fluence served as the\nenergy storage technology provider for the facility, which was completed in 2019, and Fluence previously provided maintenance services for the facility.\nThere were no injuries. The facility has been taken offline as teams from Fluence, AES, and the battery manufacturer continue to investigate the incident.\nWe are currently not able to estimate the impact, if any, that this incident may have on our reputation or financial results, or on market adoption of our\nenergy storage products and solutions.\n2023 Project-Related Litigation\n\nIn October 2023, Fluence filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California, Contra Costa County, against Diablo Energy Storage, LLC, Empire\nBusiness Park, LLC, the Bank of New York Mellon and others, seeking approximately $37.0 million in damages arising from the supply and construction of\nan energy storage facility for the defendants. On or about November 10, 2023, Defendant Diablo Energy Storage, LLC filed a cross-complaint against\nFluence, seeking a minimum of $25.0 million of alleged damages and disgorgement of all compensation received by Fluence for the project, in the amount\nof approximately $230.0 million. Fluence denies the allegations in the cross-complaint and intends to vigorously defend against them and to enforce our\nclaims against the defendants. We are currently not able to estimate the impact, if any, that this litigation may have on our reputation or financial results, or\non market adoption of our products.\n\n54\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Restructuring Plan\n\nOn November 11, 2022, the board of directors of the Company approved a restructuring plan to create a more sustainable organization structure for long\nterm growth. As part of this plan, we have relocated certain positions at high-cost locations to the Fluence India Technology Centre. The restructuring plan\nis substantially complete as of September 30, 2023. Management has the authority to expand the plan as determined necessary. As of September 30, 2023,\nwe have incurred approximately $6.7 million of costs related to the restructuring plan, which is inclusive of severance costs.\n\nInvestment in Joint Venture\n\nOn August 5, 2022, Fluence Energy Singapore PTE. LTD., a subsidiary of Fluence Energy, LLC, and ReNew Power entered into an agreement to form\na partnership in India for an initial investment of $5.0 million, plus a line of credit of $15.0 million each for a 50% interest in the partnership. We funded the\ninvestment in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The joint venture commenced operations during the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2023 and began\nhiring staff. We recorded an insignificant equity method loss on the investment for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n\nKey Factors and Trends Affecting our Performance\n\nWe  believe  that  our  performance  and  future  success  depend  on  several  factors  that  present  significant  opportunities  for  us  but  also  pose  risks  and\n\nchallenges, including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d within this Annual Report.\n\nLithium-ion Battery Cost\n\nOur revenue growth is directly tied to the continued adoption of energy storage products and solutions by our customers. The cost of lithium-ion energy\n\nstorage hardware has declined significantly in the last decade and has resulted in a large addressable market today.\n\nHowever, according to BloombergNEF\u2019s annual battery price survey issued in December 2022, higher raw material costs pushed the average price of\nlithium-ion battery packs up in calendar year 2022. The 2022 price increase marked the first annual increase in price of lithium-ion battery packs since at\nleast 2010. The market for energy storage is rapidly evolving, and while we believe costs will continue to decline over the long term, there is no guarantee\nthat they will decline at all or decline at the rates we expect. If costs do not continue to decline long term, this could adversely affect our ability to increase\nour revenue or grow our business. Considering the previous statement, we have seen prices for lithium-ion battery packs decline during calendar year 2023.\nHowever, there is no guarantee that this decline will continue during fiscal year 2024.\n\nSupply Chain\n\nAlthough we do not rely on any single supplier for the majority of our key components, including our batteries and inverters, we do obtain certain key\ncomponents from a limited number of suppliers. If one or more suppliers were unable to satisfy our requirements for particular key components, we could\nexperience  a  disruption  to  our  operations  and  delays  in  completing  our  projects  as  alternative  suppliers  are  identified  and  qualified  and  new  supply\narrangements are entered into. Moreover, if one of our suppliers is unable to satisfy our requirements and we turn to another supplier, they may ask for terms\nthat are advantageous to them at higher costs to the Company. In addition, a large portion of our suppliers are situated outside of the United States, which\nexposes us to changes in international trade regulations, taxes, tariffs, and/or quotas. As of the date of this Annual Report, we believe that we have adequate\naccess to our key components to meet the needs of our operations. See Part I, Item IA. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report for further discussion on supply\nchain risks for our business.\n\nIncreasing Deployment of Renewable Energy\n\nDeployment  of  renewable  energy  resources  has  accelerated  over  the  last  decade,  and  solar  and  wind  have  become  a  low-cost  energy  source.\nBloombergNEF estimates that renewable energy is expected to represent 70% of all new global capacity installations over the next ten years. Energy storage\nis critical to reducing the intermittency and volatility of renewable energy generation. However, there is no guarantee that the deployment of renewable\nenergy will occur at the rate estimated by BloombergNEF or that such renewable energy will rely on lithium-ion battery technology for energy storage.\nInflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, geo-political conflicts, government regulations and incentives, and other factors could result in fluctuations\nin demand for and deployment of renewable energy resources, adversely affecting our revenue and ability to generate profits in the future. See Part I, Item\nIA. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report for further discussion on these risks.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe energy storage industry is competitive and continuously evolving. Our energy storage products and solutions, services, and digital applications are\nhighly specialized and specific to the clean energy industry. The unique expertise required to design these offerings as well as integrate these solutions for\nour customers can be very complex and technical, however, the number of additional\n\n55\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##companies offering similar products and services is growing every year. In addition, we are continuously engaging in developing new use cases and opening\nnew market segments, which are often less contested. We believe that competitive factors in the energy storage market include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nsafety, reliability and quality;\nstability in supply chain;\nperformance of energy storage products and solutions, services and digital applications;\nhistorical customer track record (as the market and industry continues to grow);\nexperience in the battery energy storage system market (both of the Company and key members of leadership);\ntechnological expertise and innovation;\ncomprehensive solutions and offerings from a single provider;\nbrand recognition;\ncertain government initiatives, legislation, regulations, and policies;\nease of integration; and\nseamless hardware and software-enabled service offerings.\n\nOur competition varies by geography, country, grid service, and customer segment. There is a rising demand for energy storage products and solutions\nglobally, and with that growing demand, we see increasing numbers of new entrants and potential entrants in the energy storage space. We believe that a key\ndifferentiator for Fluence from our competitors is our ability to identify customer needs and deliver customer-centric products, services, and use cases that\ncan compete in the market either as packages or standalone offerings. We believe we compete favorably based on performance and value-creation, including\nlow total cost of ownership, long-term reliability, varied service options, and convenient and efficient sales and delivery processes.\n\nSeasonality\n\nWe  have  historically  experienced  seasonality  and  see  increased  order  intake  in  our  third  and  fourth  fiscal  quarters  (April  \u2013  September),  driven  by\ndemand in the Northern Hemisphere to install energy storage products and solutions before the summer of the following year. Combined third and fourth\nfiscal quarter order intake has historically accounted for 80% or more of our total intake each year prior to fiscal year 2022. However, combined third and\nfourth fiscal quarter order intake accounted for 48% and 43% of our total annual intake for fiscal year 2022 and 2023, respectively. In fiscal year 2024, we\ncurrently expect seasonality to return, such that our order intake in the combined third and fourth is expected to be higher than in the first half of the year.\nOur services and digital applications offerings have not historically experienced seasonality given their recurring nature.\n\nGovernment Regulation and Compliance\n\nGovernments across the globe have announced and implemented various policies, regulation and legislation to support the transition from fossil fuels to\nlow-carbon  forms  of  energy  and  to  support  and  accelerate  adoption  of  clean  and/or  reliable  distributed  generation  technologies.  The  operation  of  our\nbusiness and our customers\u2019 use of our products and services are impacted by these various government actions. For example, in August 2022, the United\nStates passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIRA\u201d), which consists of a number of provisions aimed directly at confronting the climate change\ncrisis. Among other things, the IRA introduced an investment tax credit (ITC) for standalone energy storage and it contains provisions with incentives for\ngrid  modernization  equipment  including  domestic  battery  cell  manufacturing,  battery  module  manufacturing  and  its  components,  as  well  as  various\nupstream applications.\n\nAlthough we generally are not regulated as a utility, federal, state, and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence\nthe market for our product and services. These statutes and regulations, like the IRA, often relate to electricity pricing, transmission and distribution rates,\nnet  metering,  incentives,  taxation,  competition  with  utilities  and  the  interconnection  of  customer-owned  electricity  generation.  We  believe  we  are  well\npositioned  to  capture  incentives  contained  in  the  IRA  and  that  its  enactment  is  favorable  to  our  business  and  our  future  operations.  However,  as  this\nlegislation was recently adopted in August 2022 and applicable U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service guidelines were published in the\nthird  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2023,  we  have  not  yet  seen  the  impact  these  IRA  related  incentives  may  have  on  our  business,  operations  and  financial\nperformance as we go forward and cannot guarantee we will realize anticipated benefits of incentives under the IRA. We are continuing to evaluate the\noverall impact and applicability of the IRA to our expected results of operations going forward.\n\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\n56\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Total Revenue\n\nWe generate revenue from energy storage products and solutions, service agreements with customers to provide operational services related to battery-\nbased energy storage products, and from digital application contracts. Fluence enters into contracts with utility companies, developers, and commercial and\nindustrial  customers.  We  derive  the  majority  of  our  revenues  from  selling  energy  storage  products  and  solutions.  When  we  sell  a  battery-based  energy\nstorage product and solution, we enter into a contract with our customers covering the price, specifications, delivery dates and warranty for the products\nbeing purchased, among other things. The manner in which a solution is provided to a customer may vary; not all solutions may require Fluence to procure\nbatteries  on  behalf  of  a  customer.  A  solution  may  only  require  logistics,  design,  installation  and/or  commission  services  depending  on  customer\nrequirements. We also generate revenue by providing consulting services to AES whereby Fluence has agreed to advise, and in some cases provide support\nto AES, on procurement, logistics, design, safety, and commissioning of certain of their projects.\n\nOur revenue is affected by changes in the price, volume, and mix of products and services purchased by our customers, which is driven by the demand\nfor our products, geographic mix of our customers, strength of competitors\u2019 product offerings, and availability of government incentives to the end-users of\nour  products.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  over  time  for  our  energy  storage  products  and  solutions  as  we  transfer  control  of  our  product  to  the\ncustomer. This transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contracts that provide enforceable rights to payment of the transaction price\nassociated with work performed to date for products that do not have an alternative use to the Company and/or as the project is built and control transfers\ndepending on the contract terms.\n\nOur revenue growth is dependent on continued growth in the amount of battery-based energy storage products and solutions projects constructed each\nyear and our ability to increase our share of demand in the geographic regions where we currently compete and plan to compete in the future as well as our\nability to continue to develop and commercialize new and innovative products that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our\ncustomers.\n\nCost of Goods and Services\n\nCost of goods and services consists primarily of product costs, including purchased materials and supplies, as well as costs related to shipping, customer\nsupport, product warranty, and personnel. Personnel costs in cost of goods and services includes both direct labor costs as well as costs attributable to any\nindividuals whose activities relate to the transformation of raw materials or component parts into finished goods or the transportation of materials to the\ncustomer.\n\nOur product costs are affected by the underlying cost of raw materials, including steel and aluminum supply costs, including inverters, casings, fuses,\nand cable; technological innovation; economies of scale resulting in lower supply costs; and improvements in production processes and automation. We do\nnot currently hedge against changes in the price of raw materials as we do not purchase raw materials; instead, we buy the components of energy storage\nproducts from our suppliers and we rely on our suppliers to hedge the underlying raw materials. We generally expect the ratio of cost of goods and services\nto revenue to decrease as sales volumes increase due to economies of scale, however, some of these costs, primarily personnel-related costs, are not directly\naffected by sales volume.\n\nGross Profit (Loss) and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit (loss) and gross profit margin may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our sales volume, product prices, product costs,\n\nproduct mix, customer mix, geographical mix, shipping costs, and warranty costs.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and\namortization. Personnel-related expenses are the most significant component of our operating expenses and include salaries, stock-based compensation, and\nemployee benefits. We expect to invest in additional resources to support our growth which will increase our operating expenses in the near future.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nResearch  and  development  expenses  consist  of  personnel-related  costs  across  our  global  research  and  development  (R&D)  centers  for  engineers\nengaged in the design and development and testing of our integrated products and technologies. Engineering competencies include data science, machine\nlearning, software development, network and cyber security, battery systems engineering, industrial controls, UI / UX, mechanical design, power systems\nengineering, certification, and more. R&D expenses also support three product testing labs located across the globe, including a system-level testing facility\nin Pennsylvania that is used for quality assurance and the rapid iteration, testing, and launching of new Fluence energy storage technology and products. We\nare  standing  up  an  additional  Hardware  in  the  Loop  (HIL)  testing  facility  which  is  co-located  with  our  technical  team  in  Bangalore,  India.  We  expect\nresearch and development expenses to increase in future periods to support our growth and as we continue to invest in research and\n\n57\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##development  activities  that  are  necessary  to  achieve  our  technology  and  product  roadmap  goals.  These  expenses  may  vary  from  period  to  period  as  a\npercentage of revenue, depending primarily upon when we choose to make more significant investments.\n\nSales and Marketing Expenses\n\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, stock-based compensation, and employee benefits. We\n\nhave and intend to continue to expand our sales presence and marketing efforts to additional countries in the future.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral  and  administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  personnel-related  expenses,  including  salaries,  stock-based  compensation,  and  employee\nbenefits, for our executives, finance, human resources, information technology, engineering and legal organizations that do not relate directly to the sales or\nresearch and development functions, as well as travel expenses, facilities costs, bad debt expense, and fees for professional services. Professional services\nconsist of audit, legal, tax, insurance, information technology, and other costs.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation consists of costs associated with property, plant, and equipment (\u201cPP&E\u201d) and amortization of intangibles consisting of patents, licenses,\nand  developed  technology  over  their  expected  period  of  use.  We  expect  that  as  we  increase  both  our  revenues  and  the  number  of  our  general  and\nadministrative personnel, we will invest in additional PP&E to support our growth resulting in additional depreciation and amortization.\n\nInterest (Income) Expense, net\n\nInterest  (income)  consists  of  interest  on  cash  deposits,  and  interest  on  customer  notes  receivables.  Interest  expense  consists  primarily  of  interest\npreviously incurred on our now extinguished Line of Credit and Promissory Notes (each as defined below), borrowings against notes receivable pledged as\ncollateral, unused line fees related to the revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolver\u201d) pursuant to a credit agreement, dated November 1, 2021, by and among\nFluence Energy, LLC, as the borrower, Fluence Energy, Inc., as a parent guarantor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and JP\nMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent (the \u201cRevolving Credit Agreement\u201d), which was terminated upon repayment in full\nof all obligations under the Revolver, effective November 22, 2023, and amortization of debt issuance costs.\n\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net primarily consists of (income) expense from foreign currency exchange gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.\n\nTax Expense\n\nHistorically, prior to the IPO, Fluence Energy, LLC was not subject to U.S. federal or state income tax. As such, Fluence Energy, LLC did not pay U.S.\nfederal or state income tax, as taxable income or loss will be included in the U.S. tax returns of its members. Fluence Energy LLC was subject to income\ntaxes, including withholding taxes, outside the U.S. and our income tax expense (benefit) on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive\nloss primarily relates to income taxes from foreign operations, withholding taxes on intercompany royalties and changes in valuation allowances related to\ndeferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. After our IPO, we are now subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes with respect to our allocable\nshare of any taxable income or loss of Fluence Energy, LLC, and are taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. We will continue to be subject to foreign\nincome taxes with respect to our foreign subsidiaries and our expectations are valuation allowances will be needed in certain tax jurisdictions. In addition to\ntax expenses, we also will incur expenses related to our operations, as well as payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which we expect could be\nsignificant over time. We will receive a portion of any distributions made by Fluence Energy, LLC. Any cash received from such distributions from our\nsubsidiaries will be first used by us to satisfy any tax liability and then to make payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n\nKey Operating Metrics\n\nThe following tables presents our key operating metrics and order intake for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The tables below\n\npresent the metrics in either Gigawatts (GW) or Gigawatt hours (GWh).

We start providing maintenance, monitoring, or other operational services after the storage product projects are completed. In\nsome cases, services may be commenced for energy storage solutions prior to achievement of substantial completion. This is not limited to energy storage\nsolutions  delivered  by  Fluence.  Assets  under  management  for  digital  software  represents  contracts  signed  and  active  (post  go  live).  Assets  under\nmanagement serves as an indicator of expected revenue from our customers and assists management in forecasting our expected financial performance.\n\n59\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Contracted Backlog\n\nFor our energy storage products and solutions contracts, contracted backlog includes signed customer orders or contracts under execution prior to when\nsubstantial  completion  is  achieved.  For  service  contracts,  contracted  backlog  includes  signed  service  agreements  associated  with  our  storage  product\nprojects  that  have  not  been  completed  and  the  associated  service  has  not  started.  For  digital  applications  contracts,  contracted  backlog  includes  signed\nagreements where the associated subscription has not started.\nContracted/Order Intake\n\nContracted, which we use interchangeably with \u201cOrder Intake\u201d, represents new energy storage product contracts, new service contracts and new digital\ncontracts signed during each period presented. We define \u201cContracted\u201d as a firm and binding purchase order, letter of award, change order or other signed\ncontract (in each case an \u201cOrder\u201d) from the customer that is received and accepted by Fluence. Our order intake is intended to convey the dollar amount and\ngigawatts (operating measure) contracted in the period presented. We believe that order intake provides useful information to investors and management\nbecause  the  order  intake  provides  visibility  into  future  revenues  and  enables  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company\u2019s  sales  activity  and  the\nattractiveness of its offerings in the market.\n\nPipeline\n\nPipeline represents our uncontracted, potential revenue from energy storage products, service, and digital software contracts, which have a reasonable\nlikelihood of contract execution within 24 months. Pipeline is an internal management metric that we construct from market information reported by our\nglobal sales force. Pipeline is monitored by management to understand the anticipated growth of our Company and our estimated future revenue related to\ncustomer contracts for our battery-based energy storage products and solutions, services and digital software.\n\nWe  cannot  guarantee  that  our  contracted  backlog  or  pipeline  will  result  in  actual  revenue  in  the  originally  anticipated  period  or  at  all.  Contracted\nbacklog and pipeline may not generate margins equal to our historical operating results. We have only recently begun to track our contracted backlog and\npipelines on a consistent basis as performance measures, and as a result, we do not have significant experience in determining the level of realization that we\nwill achieve on these contracts. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result of external market factors and economic or other\nfactors beyond our control. If our contracted backlog and pipeline fail to result in revenue as anticipated or in a timely manner, we could experience a\nreduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis section contains references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross\n\nProfit Margin, and Free Cash Flow.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated from the consolidated statements of operations using net income (loss) adjusted for (i) interest (income) expense, net,\n(ii)  income  taxes,  (iii)  depreciation  and  amortization,  (iv)  stock-based  compensation,  (v)  other  income  or  expenses  and  (vi)  non-recurring  income  or\nexpenses. Adjusted EBITDA may in the future also be adjusted for amounts impacting net income related to the Tax Receivable Agreement liability.\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit (Loss) is calculated using gross profit (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) stock-based compensation expenses, (ii) amortization, (iii)\ncertain other income or expenses, and (iv) non-recurring income or expenses. Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is calculated using Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss)\ndivided by total revenue.\n\nFree Cash Flow is calculated from the consolidated statements of cash flows and is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less\npurchase of property and equipment made in the period. We expect our Free Cash Flow to fluctuate in future periods as we invest in our business to support\nour plans for growth. Limitations on the use of Free Cash Flow include (i) it should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for\ndiscretionary expenditures (for example, cash is still required to satisfy other working capital needs, including short-term investment policy, restricted cash,\nand intangible assets); (ii) Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of\nother GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities; and (iii) this metric does not reflect our future contractual commitments.\n\nThese  non-GAAP  measures  are  intended  as  supplemental  measures  of  performance  and/or  liquidity  that  are  neither  required  by,  nor  presented  in\naccordance with, GAAP. We believe that such non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our operating results presented under GAAP, can be\nused to better assess our performance from period to period and relative to performance of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing\nmethods, historical cost basis or capital structure.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and\n\nmay not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. Readers are cautioned that these\n\n60\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##non-GAAP measures should not be construed as alternatives to other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-\nGAAP measures and their reconciliation to GAAP financial measures are shown below.\n\nThe following tables present our non-GAAP measures for the periods indicated.\n\nin thousands\nNet loss\nAdd (deduct):\n    Interest (income), net\n    Income tax expense\n    Depreciation and amortization\n    Stock-based compensation\n(b)\n    Other expenses\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n(a)\n\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2023\n\n2022\n\nChange\n\n Change %\n\n(104,818) $\n\n(289,177) $\n\n184,359 \n\n(5,388)\n4,549 \n10,665 \n26,920 \n6,684 \n\n(326)\n1,357 \n7,108 \n44,131 \n1,566 \n\n(61,388) $\n\n(235,341) $\n\n(5,062)\n3,192 \n3,557 \n(17,211)\n5,118 \n173,953 \n\n64 %\n\n1553 %\n235 %\n50 %\n(39)%\n327 %\n74 %\n\n$\n\n$\n\n(a) Includes awards that will be settled in shares and awards that will be settled in cash.\n(b) Amount for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 includes approximately $6.7 million of costs related to the restructuring plan, including severance.

The increase was mainly attributable to the expansion of sales of our battery-based energy storage solutions by $1.0 billion and increase of services\nrevenue by $4.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in augmentation services revenue of $6.1 million. The expansion of sales of our battery-based energy\nstorage products and solutions was primarily driven by increased volumes of Gen6 solutions sold across all regions.\n\nCosts of Goods and Services\n\nCost of goods and services increased by $816.1 million, or 64.7%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the fiscal year ended\nSeptember  30,  2022.  The  increase  in  cost  of  goods  and  services  was  mainly  attributable  to  the  expansion  of  volume  of  Gen6  solutions  sold  across  all\nregions. The increase in costs of goods and services was less than the percentage increase in revenue due to an improvement in gross margins on newer\nGen6 solutions projects and due to unusual items reducing cost of goods and services totaling $41.0 million, net. The unusual items related to (i) a $32.2\nmillion decrease in shipping and transportation costs, which were abnormally high in fiscal year 2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related\ndisruptions to the supply chain, (ii) elimination of negative effects of the Cargo Loss Incident of $9.0 million which did not recur in fiscal year 2023, (iii)\nsettlement of contractual claims with our largest battery module vendor of $19.5 million in December 2022, and (iv) reduction of stock-based compensation\nexpense by $4.3 million. Stock-based compensation expense was higher in fiscal year 2022 due to achievement of the performance condition being met\nupon the IPO. These were offset by negative impacts of period over period changes on derivative contracts of $23.9 million entered into to mitigate foreign\nexchange rate exposure on project costs, as we had gains in the prior year and losses in the current year.\n\nGross Profit (Loss) and Gross Profit Margin (Loss)\nGross profit increased by $203.3 million or 326%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30,\n2022. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to (i) improvement in gross margins on the newer Gen6 solutions projects (ii) the $41.0 million, net\nreductions in \u201cCosts of Goods and Services\u201d described above, and (iii) $9.1 million from the consulting services provided to AES.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by $6.2 million, or 10.3%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the fiscal year\nended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) an increase of $9.7 million in personnel-related costs in the current period due to\nhigher headcount and employee bonuses, which are connected to the Company\u2019s performance, to support our growth as we have been investing heavily in\nour human capital, technology, products, and solutions, and (ii) a $5.8 million increase in materials and supplies expense in relation to developing product\nprototypes. The increases were partially offset by $9.7 million of software development spend capitalized.\n\n62\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Sales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $3.9 million, or 10.5%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $2.1 million in personnel-related expenses specifically related to an increase\nin employee bonuses which were connected to the Company\u2019s performance offset by a reduction of stock-based compensation expense for the same reasons\nas described above in \u201cCosts of Goods and Services.\u201d\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $19.6 million, or 16.8%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the fiscal year\nended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel-related costs of $16.8 million due to higher headcount to\nsupport our growth and an increase in employee bonuses.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $2.7 million, or 38.4%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in depreciation of $1.8 million resulting from equipment acquired, and (ii) an\nincrease in amortization of $1.1 million related to intangible assets acquired in April 2022 from Nispera.\n\nInterest (Income) Expense, Net\nInterest income increased by $5.1 million, or 1552.8%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30,\n2022.  The  increase  was  primarily  attributable  to  (i)  an  increase  in  interest  income  of  $5.1  million  due  to  higher  interest  rates  on  cash  deposits  and\ninvestments, (ii) and an $3.5 million increase in interest income on note receivable balances with our largest customer in the Philippines. The increase was\noffset by an increase in interest expense primarily due to (i) $2.4 million of interest expense accretion on borrowing against a customer receivable and (ii)\n$0.9 million of interest expense from letters of credit issued during fiscal year 2023 pursuant to the Revolver.\n\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\n\nOther (income) expense, net increased by $11.6 million, or 250.3%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the fiscal year ended\nSeptember  30,  2022.  The  increase  in  other  income  was  primarily  attributable  to  favorable  foreign  currency  exchange  gains  for  monetary  assets  and\nliabilities.\n\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nIncome  tax  expense  increased  by  $3.2  million,  or  235.2%,  in  the  fiscal  year  ended  September  30,  2023,  as  compared  to  the  fiscal  year  ended\nSeptember 30, 2022. The increase in tax expense is primarily due to decreases in global pre-tax losses and changes in valuation allowances recorded in\nfiscal year 2023.\n\nNet Loss\nNet loss decreased by $184.4 million, or 63.8%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe decrease is primarily attributable to increase in \u201cgross profit\u201d and increase in \u201cother (income) expense, net\u201d, both as described above, partially offset by\nincreases in operating expenses as described above.\n\nComparison of the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022 to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021\n\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, please see Item\n7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on December 14, 2022.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nSince inception and through September 30, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were the proceeds from our IPO, our cash and cash equivalents,\nshort-term  borrowings,  borrowings  available  under  the  Revolver,  supply  chain  financing,  capital  contributions  from  AES  Grid  Stability  and  Siemens\nIndustry, proceeds from the QFH investment and borrowings against note receivables.\n\nWe believe the proceeds received from our IPO, cash flows from operations, borrowings against notes receivable and borrowings available under the ABL\nCredit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our expense and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months following the filing of this Annual Report.\n\nOur  future  capital  requirements  may  vary  materially  from  those  currently  planned  and  will  depend  on  many  factors,  including  our  rate  of  revenue\n\ngrowth, the timing and extent of our growth initiatives and our introduction of new products, services, and digital\n\n63\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##application offerings, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our\nfuture business activities and cash requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result\nin additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing\nsuch debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash\nflows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business,\noperations and financial condition.\n\nOn November 1, 2021, upon the closing of our IPO, we received net proceeds of $935.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering\nexpenses payable by the Company. The net proceeds from the IPO were used to purchase 35,650,000 newly issued LLC Interests directly from Fluence\nEnergy, LLC at a price per unit equal to the IPO price per share of Class A common stock less the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses\npayable by us. Fluence Energy, LLC used the net proceeds from the sale of LLC Interests to Fluence Energy, Inc. to repay all outstanding borrowings under\nthe now extinguished Line of Credit and the Promissory Notes. The remainder of the proceeds has been used for working capital and other general corporate\npurposes.\n\nPrior to the IPO, the Company had an Uncommitted Line of Credit Agreement (\u201cLine of Credit\u2019) with Citibank, N.A. (\u201cCitibank\u201d) which allowed us to\nborrow an amount in aggregate not to exceed $50 million, with the expiration date on March 31, 2023. Outstanding borrowings from the Line of Credit were\n$50.0 million as of September 30, 2021. The weighted average annual interest rate of the borrowing was 2.83%. On November 1, 2021, the $50 million\noutstanding borrowings from the Line of Credit was paid off using the proceeds from our IPO and the Line of Credit was canceled shortly thereafter.\n\nAdditionally,  prior  to  the  IPO,  we  funded  our  liquidity  through  borrowings  from  AES  Grid  Stability  and  Siemens  Industry.  On  August  11,  2021,\nFluence Energy, LLC entered into a promissory note with each of Siemens Industry and AES Grid Stability, under which Fluence Energy, LLC received a\nbridge financing of an aggregate of $50.0 million. In connection with the bridge financing, Fluence Energy, LLC issued a $25.0 million promissory note to\neach of Siemens Industry and AES Grid Stability (together, the \u201cPromissory Notes\u201d). The Promissory Notes bore interest at a rate of 2.86%. The Promissory\nNotes were repaid on November 1, 2021 using proceeds from the IPO.\n\nWe have provided certain of our suppliers with access to a supply chain financing program through a third-party financing institution (the \u201cSCF Bank\u201d).\nThis program allows us to seek extended payment terms with our suppliers and allows our suppliers to monetize their receivables prior to the payment due\ndate, subject to a discount. Once a supplier elects to participate in the program and reaches an agreement with the SCF Bank, the supplier elects which\nindividual invoices to sell to the SCF Bank. We then pay the SCF Bank on the invoice due date. We have no economic interest in a supplier\u2019s decision to sell\na receivable to the SCF Bank. The agreements between our suppliers and the SCF Bank are solely at their discretion and are negotiated directly between\nthem. Our suppliers\u2019 ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of our financial condition and guarantees issued by\nAES and Siemens. As of September 30, 2023, AES and Siemens issued guarantees of $50.0 million each, for a total of $100.0 million, to SCF Bank on our\nbehalf.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, three suppliers were actively participating in the supply chain financing program, and we had $30.0 million of payables\noutstanding subject to the program. All outstanding payments owed under the program are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\n\nOn August 11, 2023, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC which became effective upon filing and will remain\neffective for three years from the effectiveness date. The Form S-3 allows us to offer and sell from time-to-time Class A common stock, preferred stock,\ndepository shares, debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts or units comprised of any combination of these securities for our own account and allows\ncertain selling stockholders to offer and sell 135,666,665 shares of Class A common stock in one or more offerings.\n\nThe Form S-3 is intended to provide us flexibility to conduct registered sales of our securities, subject to market conditions and our future capital needs.\nThe terms of any future offering under the shelf registration statement will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus\nsupplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering.\n\nRevolving Credit Facility\n\nWe entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement for a Revolving Credit Facility (the \u201cRevolver\u201d) on November 1, 2021, by and among Fluence Energy,\nLLC, as the borrower, Fluence Energy Inc., as a parent guarantor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and JP Morgan Chase\nBank,  N.A.,  as  administrative  agent  and  collateral  agent.  As  of  September  30,  2023,  the  aggregate  amount  of  commitments  was  $200.0  million.  The\nRevolver was originally scheduled to mature on November 1, 2025. The Revolving Credit Agreement was terminated effective November 22, 2023, in\nconjunction with the entry into the new ABL Credit Agreement (as further described below).\n\n64\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##The Revolver was secured by (i) a first priority pledge of the equity securities of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries and (ii) first priority security\ninterests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material fee-owned real property of Fluence Energy, LLC, the\nparent guarantor and each subsidiary guarantor party thereto, in each case, subject to customary exceptions and limitations. On May 19, 2023, the Revolving\nCredit Agreement was amended to replace Adjusted LIBOR with Adjusted Term SOFR as the applicable benchmark interest rate with respect to certain\nclasses of loans. The Company elected the optional practical expedient as it related to our Revolver as the amendment did not modify terms that changed or\nhad the potential to change, the amount and timing of cash flows unrelated to the replacement of LIBOR.\n\nThe Revolver bore interest at either (i) the Adjusted SOFR Rate (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus 3.0 % or (ii) the Alternate\nBase Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus 2.0% (subject to customary LIBOR replacement provisions and alternative benchmark rates\nincluding customary spread adjustments with respect to borrowings in foreign currency), at the option of Fluence Energy, LLC. Fluence Energy, LLC was\nrequired to pay to the lenders a commitment fee of 0.55 % per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving commitments through maturity,\nwhich was originally scheduled to be the four-year anniversary of the closing date of the Revolver. The Revolver also provided for up to $200.0 million in\nletter of credit issuances, which required customary issuance and administration fees, as well as a fronting fee payable to each issuer thereof and a letter of\ncredit participation fee of 2.75% per annum payable to the lenders.\n\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contained covenants that, among other things, restricted our ability to incur additional indebtedness; incur liens; sell,\ntransfer, or dispose of property and assets; make investments or acquisitions; make dividends, distributions, or other restricted payments; and engage in\naffiliate transactions. The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement limited our ability to make certain payments, including dividends and distributions on\nFluence Energy, LLC\u2019s equity, Fluence Energy, Inc.\u2019s equity and other restricted payments. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, Fluence\nEnergy, LLC and its subsidiaries were limited in their ability to pay cash dividends to, lend to, or make other investments in Fluence Energy, Inc., subject to\ncertain exceptions, including among others (i) the ability to make investments of up to the greater of (a) $10,500,000 and (b) 1.5% of the consolidated assets\nof Fluence Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and (ii) the ability to issue dividends and make other Restricted Payments (as defined in the Revolving Credit\nAgreement)  (a)  if  after  giving  pro  forma  effect  to  such  dividend  or  other  Restricted  Payment  the  Total  Liquidity  (as  defined  in  the  Revolving  Credit\nAgreement) of Fluence Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries party to the Revolving Credit Agreement was at least $600,000,000, or (b) such dividend or other\nRestricted  Payment  was  made  to  reimburse  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  for  certain  tax  distributions  under  the  Fluence  Energy  LLC  Agreement  and  certain\npayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and certain operational expenses incurred in connection with the ownership and management of Fluence\nEnergy, LLC. In addition, we were required to maintain (i) minimum liquidity and gross revenue requirements, in each case, until consolidated EBITDA\nreached $150.0 million for the most recent four fiscal quarters and we made an election, and (ii) thereafter, a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum\ninterest coverage ratio. Such covenants were tested on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all such covenants or\nmaintained availability above such covenant triggers.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had no borrowings under the Revolver and $35.9 million of letters of credit outstanding, and availability under the\n\nfacility of $164.1 million net of letters of credit issued.\n\nAsset-Based Lending Facility\n\nOn November 22, 2023, the Company entered into an asset-based syndicated credit agreement with revolving commitments in an aggregate principal\namount  of  $400.0  million  (the  \"ABL  Facility\"),  by  and  among  Fluence  Energy,  LLC,  as  parent  borrower,  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.,  as  parent,  the  other\nborrowers party thereto, the other guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto, and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent (the \"ABL Credit\nAgreement\"). The ABL Facility is secured by (i) a first priority pledge of Fluence Energy, Inc.\u2019s equity interests in Fluence Energy, LLC and (ii) first\npriority security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material fee-owned real property of Fluence\nEnergy, Inc., Fluence Energy, LLC and Fluence Energy Global Production Operation, LLC, in each case, subject to customary exceptions and limitations.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility will mature, and lending commitments thereunder will terminate, on November 22, 2027.\n\nThe ABL Facility provides for a borrowing base that is an amount equal to (a) the lesser of (i) 75% of each borrower's Eligible Inventory (as defined in\nthe ABL Credit Agreement) (valued as set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement) and (ii) the product of (x) 85% multiplied by (y) the Net Orderly Liquidation\nValue (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) percentage identified in the most recent inventory appraisal delivered to the administrative agent multiplied\nby  (z)  the  borrowers'  Eligible  Inventory,  plus  (b)  the  lesser  of  (i)  75%  of  each  borrower's  Eligible  In-Transit  Inventory  (as  defined  in  the  ABL  Credit\nAgreement)  (valued  as  set  forth  in  the  ABL  Credit  Agreement)  and  (ii)  the  product  of  (x)  85%  multiplied  by  (y)  the  Net  Orderly  Liquidation  Value\npercentage  identified  in  the  most  recent  inventory  appraisal  delivered  to  the  administrative  agent  multiplied  by  (z)  the  borrowers'  Eligible  In-Transit\nInventory; provided that the aggregate amount of (A) Eligible In-Transit Inventory included in the borrowing base at any time, plus (B) all Customer In-\nTransit Inventory (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) included in the borrowing base shall not exceed the In-Transit Inventory Cap (as defined in the\nABL Credit Agreement) then in effect; minus (c) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any. The Company will provide a borrowing base certificate to lenders\n20 days following the end of each calendar month, except during a reporting trigger period where it will provide such certificates on a weekly basis. The\nABL Credit Agreement provides for a full cash dominion period (a) if an event of default is occurring or (b) after the Availability Requirement Holiday (as\ndefined in the ABL Credit\n\n65\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Agreement), beginning on the date on which Excess Availability (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) is less than the greater of (i) 12.5% of the Line\nCap (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) and (ii) if the borrowing base then in effect is (A) less than $200.0 million, $25.0 million and (B) greater\nthan or equal to $200.0, $50.0 million.\n\nThe ABL Credit Agreement sets forth that (i) loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) shall bear interest at\nthe Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) plus an additional margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50%, depending on the Average\nExcess Availability (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) during the applicable determination period, (ii) loans comprising each Canadian Prime Loan\nBorrowing (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) shall bear interest at the Canadian Prime Rate (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) plus  an\nadditional  margin  ranging  from  1.00%  to  1.50%,  depending  on  the  Average  Excess  Availability  (as  defined  in  the  ABL  Credit  Agreement)  during  the\napplicable determination period, and (iii) the loans comprising each Term Benchmark Borrowing (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) shall  bear\ninterest  at  the  Adjusted  Term  SOFR  Rate,  the  Adjusted  EURIBOR  Rate  or  Adjusted  Daily  Compounded  CORRA  (each  as  defined  in  the  ABL  Credit\nAgreement), as applicable, plus an additional margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50%, depending on the Average Excess Availability during the applicable\ndetermination period, in each instance subject to customary benchmark replacement provisions including, but not limited to, alternative benchmark rates,\ncustomary spread adjustments with respect to borrowings in foreign currencies and benchmark replacement conforming changes. Fluence Energy, LLC is\nrequired to pay to the lenders a commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the commitments through maturity, which shall accrue at the rate of\n(a) until the last day of the first full calendar quarter following the closing of the ABL Facility, 0.450% per annum, and (b) thereafter, 0.450% per annum if\naverage revolving loan utilization is less than or equal to 50% and 0.375% per annum if average revolving loan utilization is greater than 50%. The ABL\nFacility also provides for an initial letter of credit sublimit in the amount of $167.5 million, which sublimit may be increased to $200.0 million, if certain\nconditions  are  met.  Each  letter  of  credit  issuance  will  be  conditioned  upon,  among  other  conditions,  the  payment  of  certain  customary  issuance  and\nadministration fees, as well as payment of a fronting fee to each issuer thereof and payment of a letter of credit participation fee payable to the lenders.\n\nThe ABL Credit Agreement contains customary covenants for this type of financing, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict our ability to\nincur indebtedness; incur liens; sell, transfer, or dispose of property and assets; make investments or acquisitions; pay dividends, make distributions or other\nrestricted payments; and engage in affiliate transactions. The ABL Credit Agreement limits our ability to make certain payments, including dividends and\ndistributions on Fluence Energy, LLC\u2019s equity, the Company\u2019s equity and other restricted payments. Under the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement, Fluence\nEnergy, LLC and its subsidiaries are currently limited in their ability to pay cash dividends to, lend to, or make other investments in Fluence Energy, Inc.,\nsubject  to  certain  exceptions.  In  addition,  if  certain  payment  conditions  under  the  ABL  Credit  Agreement  are  satisfied,  including  the  satisfaction  of  a\nminimum excess availability requirement, then additional specified transactions may be made by the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company agreed\nthat it will not, and its subsidiaries will not, permit Total Liquidity (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) at any time to be less than the greater of (i)\n20% of the Line Cap then in effect and (ii) $64.0 million, and the Company agreed that it will not, and its subsidiaries will not, permit Excess Availability to\nbe less than the greater of (i) $15.0 million and (ii) 10% of the Line Cap then in effect. Such covenants will be tested on a quarterly basis and upon certain\nrestricted payments, the incurrence of indebtedness, certain dispositions and other Specified Transactions (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement).\n\nBorrowings Against Note Receivable - Pledged as Collateral\nIn  December  2022,  we  transferred  $24.3  million  in  customer  receivables  to  Standard  Chartered  Bank  (\u201cSCB\u201d)  in  the  Philippines  for  proceeds  of\n$21.1 million. The receivables all related to our largest customer in that country. The underlying receivables transferred were previously aggregated into a\nlong term note, with interest, and which has a maturity date of September 30, 2024 and was previously classified under \u201cOther non-current assets\u201d on our\nconsolidated balance sheet. In April 2023, we aggregated into an additional long term note and transferred an additional $30.9 million in receivables with\nthe  same  customer  to  SCB  for  proceeds  of  $27.0  million,  upon  substantially  similar  terms  as  the  December  2022  transfer  and  has  a  maturity  date  of\nDecember 27, 2024. These transactions are treated as secured borrowings as we did not transfer the entire note receivables due from the customer to SCB.\nWe continue to receive quarterly interest income from the customer, while SCB is responsible for collecting payments on the principal balances which\nrepresent the initial receivable balances from the customer. We have no other continuing involvement or exposure related to the underlying receivables. As\nof September 30, 2023, we recorded net interest income of $1.0 million, which represents the aggregate of $3.4 million in interest income recorded in\n\u201cInterest (income) expense,net\u201d and $2.4 million in interest expense.\n\nTax Receivable Agreement\n\nIn connection with the IPO, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with Fluence Energy, LLC and Siemens Industry and AES Grid Stability\n(together, the \u201cFounders\u201d). Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are required to make cash payments to the Founders equal to 85% of the tax benefits,\nif any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (1) the increases in our share of the tax basis of assets of\nFluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries resulting from any redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests from the Founders and certain distributions (or\ndeemed distributions) by Fluence Energy, LLC; and (2) certain other tax benefits arising from payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payment\nobligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement is an obligation of Fluence Energy, Inc. and not of Fluence Energy, LLC. We expect to use distributions\nfrom Fluence Energy, LLC to fund any payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent we\n\n66\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest\nuntil paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement resulting in the acceleration of payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Fluence Energy, Inc. expects to benefit from the remaining\n15% of cash tax benefits, if any, it realizes from such tax benefits. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the cash tax benefits will be computed by\ncomparing the actual income tax liability of Fluence Energy, Inc. to the amount of such taxes that Fluence Energy, Inc. would have been required to pay had\nthere been no such tax basis adjustments of the assets of Fluence Energy, LLC or its subsidiaries as a result of redemptions or exchanges and had Fluence\nEnergy, Inc. not entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n\nRedemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests post-IPO are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the assets of Fluence Energy, LLC and\ncertain  of  its  subsidiaries.  Increases  in  tax  basis  and  tax  basis  adjustments  generated  over  time  may  increase  (for  tax  purposes)  the  depreciation  and\namortization deductions available to Fluence Energy, Inc. and, therefore, may reduce the amount of U.S. federal, state, and local tax that Fluence Energy,\nInc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of the validity of that tax basis, and a court could sustain\nsuch  a  challenge.  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.\u2019s  allocable  share  of  tax  basis  and  the  anticipated  tax  basis  adjustments  upon  redemptions  or  exchanges  of  LLC\nInterests may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those assets. Actual tax\nbenefits realized by Fluence Energy, Inc. may differ from tax benefits calculated under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of the use of certain\nassumptions  in  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement,  including  the  use  of  an  assumed  state  and  local  income  tax  rate  to  calculate  tax  benefits.  The  payment\nobligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement is an obligation of Fluence Energy, Inc. and not of Fluence Energy, LLC. We expect to use distributions\nfrom Fluence Energy, LLC to fund any payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent we are unable to\nmake timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid;\nprovided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement\nresulting in the acceleration of payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Fluence Energy, Inc. expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash\ntax benefits, if any, it realizes from such tax benefits. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the cash tax benefits will be computed by comparing\nthe actual income tax liability of Fluence Energy, Inc. to the amount of such taxes that Fluence Energy, Inc. would have been required to pay had there been\nno such tax basis adjustments of the assets of Fluence Energy, LLC or its subsidiaries as a result of redemptions or exchanges and had Fluence Energy, Inc.\nnot entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. The actual and hypothetical tax liabilities determined in the Tax Receivable Agreement will be calculated\nusing the actual U.S. federal income tax rate in effect for the applicable period and an assumed state and local income tax rate (along with the use of certain\nother assumptions). The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless Fluence Energy,\nInc. exercises its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, certain changes of control occur or Fluence Energy, Inc. breaches any of its material\nobligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, in which case, all obligations generally (and in the case of such a change of control or such breach, only if\nthe Founders elect) will be accelerated and due as if Fluence Energy, Inc. had exercised its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payment to\nbe  made  upon  an  early  termination  of  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  will  generally  equal  the  present  value  of  payments  to  be  made  under  the  Tax\nReceivable Agreement using certain assumptions. Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement is by its\nnature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. The tax basis adjustments upon the redemption or exchange\nof LLC Interests, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors,\nincluding the timing of purchases or exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the purchase or exchange, the extent to\nwhich such purchases or exchanges do not result in a basis adjustment, the amount of tax attributes, changes in tax rates and the amount and timing of our\nincome.\n\nOn June 30, 2022, Siemens Industry, Inc. exercised its redemption right pursuant to the terms of LLC Agreement with respect to its entire holding of\n58,586,695 LLC Interests of Fluence Energy, LLC, together with the corresponding cancellation of an equivalent number of shares of Class B-1 common\nstock of Fluence Energy, Inc., par value $0.00001 per share (the \u201cSiemens Redemption\u201d). The Siemens Redemption resulted in increases in the tax basis of\nthe  assets  of  Fluence  Energy,  LLC  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries.  The  increases  in  tax  basis  and  tax  basis  adjustments  increases  (for  tax  purposes)  the\ndepreciation and amortization deductions available to Fluence Energy, Inc. and, therefore, may reduce the amount of U.S. federal, state, and local tax that\nFluence Energy, Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of the validity of that tax basis, and a court\ncould sustain such a challenge.\n\nAs  a  result  of  the  tax  basis  adjustment  of  the  assets  of  Fluence  Energy,  LLC  and  its  subsidiaries  upon  the  Siemens  Redemption  and  our  possible\nutilization of certain tax attributes, the payments that we may make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. The Siemens Redemption will\nresult in future tax savings of $96.5 million. Siemens AG will be entitled to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement equaling 85% of such\namount, or $82.0 million; assuming, among other factors, (i) we will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefits; (ii) Fluence Energy, LLC\nis able to fully depreciate or amortize its assets; and (iii) no material changes in applicable tax law. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are\nnot conditioned upon continued ownership of us by the Founders. Although the timing and extent of future payments could vary significantly under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement for the factors discussed above, we anticipate funding payments from the Tax Receivable Agreement\n\n67\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##from cash flow from operations of our subsidiaries, available cash or available borrowings under any future debt agreements, and such payments are not\nanticipated to be dependent upon the availability of proceeds of the IPO.\n\nWe determined it is not probable payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would be made, given there is no expectation of future sufficient\ntaxable  income  over  the  term  of  the  agreement  to  utilize  deductions  in  the  future.  Therefore,  the  Company  has  not  recognized  the  liability.  Should  we\ndetermine that the Tax Receivable Agreement payment is probable, a corresponding liability will be recorded and as a result, our future results of operations\nand earnings could be impacted as a result of these matters.\n\nCredit Support and Reimbursement Agreement\nWe are party to an Amended and Restated Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement with AES and Siemens Industry whereby they may, from\ntime to time, agree to furnish credit support to us in the form of direct issuances of credit support to our lenders or other beneficiaries or through their\nlenders\u2019 provision of letters of credit to backstop our own facilities or obligations. Pursuant to the Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement, if AES or\nSiemens Industry agree to provide a particular credit support (which they are permitted to grant or deny in their sole discretion), they are entitled to receipt\nof  a  credit  support  fee  and  reimbursement  for  all  amounts  paid  to  our  lenders  or  other  counterparties,  payable  upon  demand.  The  Credit  Support  and\nReimbursement Agreement will not provide any credit support from September 30, 2026, provided that either AES or Siemens Industry will be permitted to\nterminate the agreement upon six months prior notice.\n\nCommitments, Contingent Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nAs  of  September  30,  2023,  the  Company  had  outstanding  bank  guarantees,  parent  guarantees  and  surety  bonds  issued  as  performance  security\narrangements for several customer projects. The Company has certain battery purchase obligations under a master supply agreement with a supplier. We are\nalso  party  to  both  assurance  and  service-type  warranties  for  various  lengths  of  time.  Refer  to  \u201cNote  14  -  Commitments  and  Contingencies\u201d  to  our\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information regarding our contingent obligations, including off-balance\nsheet arrangements, and legal contingencies.\n\nHistorical Cash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods presented.\n\nin thousands\nNet cash used in operating activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n\n$\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nChange\n\nChange %\n\n(111,927) $\n\n94,437 \n52,595 \n\n(282,385) $\n(148,417)\n817,053 \n\n170,458 \n242,854 \n(764,458)\n\n60.4 %\n163.6 %\n(93.6)%\n\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n\nNet cash flows used in operating activities was $111.9 million in fiscal year 2023, compared $282.4 million in fiscal year 2022, representing a decrease\n$170.5 million in net cash used in operations. The decrease was mainly due a decrease in net loss of $184.4 million period over period offset by a reduction\nof insurances proceeds received of $10.0 million.\n\nNet cash flows provided by investing activities was $94.4 million in fiscal year 2023, compared to net cash flows used in investing activities of $148.4\nmillion in fiscal year 2022, representing an increase of $242.9 million. Fiscal year 2023 included $111.7 million from proceeds of short-term investments,\noffset by $5.0 million in payments for investment in joint ventures, $9.2 million in capital expenditures on software, and $3.0 million purchases of property\nand  equipment.  Fiscal  year  2022  included  $110.1  million  for  the  purchase  of  short-term  investments,  $29.2  million  related  to  cash  paid  for  a  business\nacquisition, and $7.9 million purchases of property and equipment.\n\nCash  flows  provided  by  financing  activities  was  $52.6  million  in  fiscal  year  2023,  compared  to  $817.1  million  in  fiscal  year  2022,  representing  a\ndecrease  of  $764.5  million.  Cash  flows  provided  by  financing  activities  in  fiscal  year  2023  was  primarily  driven  by  $48.2  million  in  proceeds  from\nborrowing against note receivable - pledged as collateral and $7.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by $2.8 million in cash\noutflows from repurchases of class A common stock placed into treasury. Cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2022 was primarily\ndriven by $935.8 million of proceeds from issuance of Class A common stock sold in an IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, offset by\n$50.0 million repayment of promissory notes and $50.0 million repayment of line of credit.\n\n68\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the preparation of these financial statements, we consider an accounting\njudgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the\nuse of different judgments, estimates, and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the accounting\npolicies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving\nmanagement\u2019s judgments and estimates.\n\nRevenue Recognition - Sale of Energy Storage Products\nThe  Company  enters  into  contracts  with  utility  companies,  developers,  and  commercial  and  industrial  customers  to  design  and  build  battery-based\nenergy storage products. Each storage product is customized depending on the customer\u2019s energy needs. Customer payments are due upon meeting certain\nmilestones that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. The Company determines the transaction price based on the consideration expected\nto  be  received  which  includes  estimates  of  liquidated  damages  (\u201cLDs\u201d)  or  other  variable  consideration  that  are  included  in  the  transaction  price  in\naccordance  with  ASC  606.  We  assess  any  variable  consideration  using  an  expected  value  method.  The  transaction  price  identified  is  allocated  to  each\ndistinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service based on the relative standalone selling prices. Generally, the Company\u2019s contracts to design and\nbuild battery-based storage products are determined to have one performance obligation. When shipping and handling activities are performed after the\ncustomer obtains control of the product, we elect to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the product.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue over time as we transfer control of our product to the customer. This transfer of control to the customer is supported\nby clauses in the contracts, that provides enforceable rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date for products that do\nnot have an alternative use to the Company and/or as the project is built and control transfers depending on the contract terms.\n\nRevenue for these performance obligations is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total\nestimated contract costs. Standard inventory materials (including batteries, enclosures, chillers, and others, which are assembled into \u201ccubes\u201d) that could be\nused  interchangeably  on  other  projects  are  included  in  our  measure  of  progress  when  they  are  integrated  into,  or  restricted  to,  the  production  of  the\ncustomer\u2019s project. Due to the significance of the costs associated with cubes, our judgement on when such costs should be included in the measure of\nprogress has a material impact on revenue recognition. Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs related to contract performance. Pre-contract\ncosts with no future benefit are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Since the revenue recognition of these contracts depends on estimates,\nwhich  are  assessed  continually  during  the  term  of  the  contract,  recognized  revenues  and  profit  are  subject  to  revisions  as  the  contract  progresses  to\ncompletion. The cumulative effects of revisions of estimated total contract costs and revenues, together with any contract reserves which may be deemed\nappropriate, are recorded in the period in which they occur. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that these\nestimates will be revised in a different period. When a loss is forecasted for a contract, the full amount of the anticipated loss is recognized in the period in\nwhich it is determined that a loss will occur.\n\nOur contracts generally provide our customers the right to liquidated damages against Fluence in the event specified milestones are not met on time, or\nequipment is not delivered according to contract specifications. Liquidated damages are accounted for as variable consideration, and the contract price is\nreduced by the expected penalty or LD amount when recognizing revenue. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that\nit is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Estimating variable\nconsideration requires certain estimates and assumptions, including whether and by how much a project will be delayed and/or will not meet performance\ncontractual  specifications.  The  existence  and  measurement  of  liquidated  damages  may  also  be  impacted  by  our  judgements  about  the  probability  of\nfavorable outcomes of customer disputes involving whether certain events qualify as force majeure or the reason for the events that caused project delays.\nVariable consideration for liquidated damages is estimated using the expected value of the consideration to be received.\n\nAt times Fluence will incur additional costs to execute on the performance of a contract. When this happens, we typically attempt to recover the revenue\nassociated with these costs via a change order with the customer. When this fact pattern occurs, it will create a timing difference between when we have\nincurred  the  cost  versus  when  we  record  the  revenue  as  costs  are  recognized  immediately  when  incurred  and  the  revenue  from  the  change  order  is\nrecognized as an increase to contract price when it is legally enforceable, which is usually upon signing a respective change order or equivalent document\nconfirming the claim acceptance by customer. Revenue is recorded net of any taxes assessed on and collected from customers, which are remitted to the\ngovernmental authorities.\n\nRefer  to  \u201cNote  2  -  Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies  and  Estimates\u201d  for  further  discussion  of  other  accounting  policies  and  estimates\n\nincluding income taxes, goodwill, and loss contracts.\n\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nMarket  risk  is  the  potential  loss  that  may  result  from  market  changes  associated  with  our  business  or  with  an  existing  or  forecasted  financial\n\ntransactions. We are exposed to various market risks in the ordinary course of our business which are discussed below.\n\n69\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations resulting in a loss to us. Our counterparties for sale of our\nenergy  storage  products  and  solutions  and  delivery  service  are  customers  including  conglomerates,  utilities  /  load-serving  entities,  independent  power\nproducers, developers, and C&I customers in the United States and other countries. A loss of one or more of our significant customers, their inability to\nperform under their contracts, or their default in payment could harm our business and negatively impact revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCredit policies have been approved and implemented to govern our portfolio of counterparties with the objective of mitigating credit losses. These policies\nestablish guidelines, controls, and limits to manage credit risk within approved tolerances by mandating an appropriate evaluation of the financial condition\nof existing and potential counterparties, monitoring agency credit ratings, and by implementing credit practices that limit exposure according to the risk\nprofiles of the counterparties. In addition, customers are required to make milestone payments based on their project\u2019s progress. We may also, at times,\nrequire letters of credit, parent guarantees or cash collateral when deemed necessary.\n\nOur overall exposure may be affected positively or negatively by macroeconomic or regulatory changes that impact our counterparties to one extent or\nanother.  Currently,  management  does  not  anticipate  a  material  adverse  effect  in  our  financial  position  or  results  of  operations  as  a  consequence  of\ncounterparty non-performance. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of all our counterparties.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, while certain of our current subsidiaries have other functional currencies, reflecting their principal operating\nmarkets. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, the Canadian Dollar, and the\nSwiss Franc in our current foreign markets could create significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Our foreign currency derivatives are primarily\nused to mitigate foreign currency risk related to foreign denominated supply arrangements with the changes in fair value recognized as a component of Cost\nof Goods and Services. To date, we have not had material exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and have not had material hedging instruments to hedge\nthe foreign currency risks.\n\nCommodity Price Risk\n\nWe are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, including steel, aluminum and lithium, that are used in the\ncomponents from suppliers that are inputs into our products. Prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other logistic costs\nmarket factors from time to time. As we are not the direct buyer of these raw materials, we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity\nrisk. Significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if suppliers increase component prices and we are unable to\nrecover such increases from our customers and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nCustomer Concentration and Emerging Market Exposure Risk\n\nWe deliver products and services in developed economies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Chile, Ireland, Switzerland, Australia,\nGermany, and other developed countries. We also deliver products and services in the Philippines and India, which represent an aggregate 3% and 6% of\nrevenue for the fiscal year 2023 and 2022, respectively. Macroeconomic conditions in developing economies are usually more volatile than in developed\neconomies and entail certain risks and uncertainties. Changes in the United States and other countries\u2019 trade environment, including the imposition of import\ntariffs, could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues, results of operations, or cash flows. The interruption of the flow of components and\nmaterials from international vendors could disrupt our supply chain, including as a result of the imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges on\nimports and exports.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nWe  were  previously  exposed  to  interest  rate  risk  in  connection  with  borrowings  under  the  Revolver,  which  bore  interest  at  floating  rates,  and  we\ncurrently are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement, which bears interest at floating rates. We entered\ninto the Revolver on November 1, 2021, which bears a variable interest rate based on the Adjusted SOFR Rate or the Alternate Base Rate (each as defined\nin the Revolving Credit Agreement). As of September 30, 2023, we have no borrowings under the Revolver. Effective November 22, 2023, we terminated\nthe Revolver and entered into the ABL Credit Agreement, under which borrowings bear a variable interest rate based on the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate,\nAlternate  Base  Rate,  Adjusted  EURIBOR  Rate,  or  Adjusted  Daily  Compounded  CORRA  Rate,  plus  applicable  margin  depending  on  available  excess\navailability (each as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement).\n\n70\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##ITEM 8.

(the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders\u2019 equity, members\u2019 equity (deficit) and mezzanine equity and cash\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, the related notes and the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item\n15(a) (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 29, 2023 expressed an adverse\nopinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company\nin accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures\nto assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required\nto be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially  challenging,  subjective  or  complex  judgments.  The  communication  of  the  critical  audit  matter  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nDescription of the\nMatter\n\nRevenue Recognition \u2013 Transfer of Control\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized $2,197.6 million\nof revenue from the sale of battery-based energy storage solutions. Revenue from these sales is recognized over\ntime,  using  the  percentage  of  completion  method  based  on  costs  incurred  as  a  percentage  of  total  estimated\ncontract  costs.  Standard  inventory  materials  (including  batteries,  enclosures,  chillers,  and  others,  which  are\nassembled  into  \u201ccubes\u201d)  that  could  be  used  interchangeably  on  other  projects  are  included  in  the  measure  of\nprogress when they are integrated into, or restricted to, the specific customer project. Due to the significance of\nthe costs associated with cubes, the inclusion of such costs in the measure of progress has a material impact on\nrevenue recognition.\n \nAuditing  the  Company\u2019s  revenue  recognition  required  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment  and  more  extensive\naudit  procedures  due  to  the  complexity  involved  in  determining  whether  the  costs  associated  with  cubes  are\nappropriately included in the measure of progress in the Company\u2019s percentage of completion calculation.\n\n72\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##How We Addressed\nthe Matter in Our\nAudit\n\nTo evaluate whether costs associated with cubes were appropriately included in the measure of progress when\nrevenue was recognized, our audit procedures included, among others, selecting a sample of customer contracts\nand  reviewing  them  including  any  change  orders,  to  understand  the  terms  impacting  when  the  cubes  were\nintegrated  into  or  restricted  to  the  customer\u2019s  project.  We  also  obtained  confirmation  from  customers  of  the\ncontractual terms as well as the timing and quantity of cubes delivered, and, in the absence of a change order, that\nthe  customer  had  requested  delivery  to  an  alternate  location  and  had  accepted  legal  title  to  the  cubes.\nAdditionally, we inspected the cubes at the customers\u2019 locations. In order to verify the completeness and accuracy\nof  the  Company\u2019s  records,  we  also  obtained  confirmation  of  the  quantity  and  timing  of  cube  shipments  to\ncustomer locations directly from the Company\u2019s contract manufacturers and inspected delivery documents.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2018.\n\nTysons, VA\n\nNovember 29, 2023\n\n73\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Fluence Energy, Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Fluence Energy, Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our\nopinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Fluence Energy, Inc.\n(the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility\nthat a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following\nmaterial weakness has been identified and included in management\u2019s assessment. Management has identified a material weakness in controls related to the\nCompany\u2019s revenue recognition process.\n\nWe  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the  2023\nconsolidated financial statements of the Company. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied\nin  our  audit  of  the  2023  consolidated  financial  statements,  and  this  report  does  not  affect  our  report  dated  November  29,  2023,  which  expressed  an\nunqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal  control  over  financial  reporting  included  in  the  accompanying  Report  of  Management  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial  Reporting.  Our\nresponsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company\u2019s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on  our  audit.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nTysons, VA\nNovember 29, 2023\n\n74\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK## \n\nFLUENCE ENERGY, INC.\n\nCONSOLIDATED

Fluence Energy, LLC is a variable interest\nentity,  of  which  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  beneficially  owns  a  66.99%  interest  as  of  September  30,  2023.  For  accounting  purposes,  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  is\nconsidered the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates the results of Fluence Energy, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Prior to the IPO,\nFluence Energy, Inc. had no operations and had no assets or liabilities. Accordingly, financial results, balances, and other information included herein for\nperiods prior to the IPO are reflective of Fluence Energy, LLC. The table below summarizes the ownership structure at the end of each respective period:\n\nControlling Interest Ownership\nNon-Controlling Interest Ownership (AES)\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n66.99 %\n33.01 %\n\n66.22 %\n33.78 %\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from\nthose estimates. Items subject to such estimates and assumptions include: the valuation of acquired and assumed liabilities for business acquired, the relative\nfair value allocations to contingencies with multiple elements, the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets; impairment of goodwill,\nintangible assets, and long-lived assets; valuation allowances for inventories; deferred tax assets; revenue recognized under the percentage-of-completion\nmethod; accrued bonuses; and various project related provisions including but not limited to estimated losses, warranty obligations, and liquidated damages.\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on-hand and highly liquid investments readily convertible to cash, with an original maturity of 90 days or less\n\nwhen purchased.\n\n84\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Cash restricted for use as a result of financing or other obligations is classified separately as restricted cash. If the purpose of restricted cash relates to\nacquiring a long-term asset, liquidating a long-term liability, or is otherwise unavailable for a period longer than one year from the balance sheet date, the\nrestricted cash is included in \u201cother non-current assets.\u201d Otherwise, restricted cash is included as a separate line item on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance\nsheets.\n\nThe Company typically retains cash for operations within one or more bank accounts. These accounts may hold cash in excess of the FDIC limit of\n$250,000. As a result, we are subject to concentration risk associated with the underlying custodial banks with whom deposits of cash and cash equivalents\nin  excess  of  the  FDIC  limits  are  held.  If  access  to  these  accounts  is  delayed  or  suspended  indefinitely,  it  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the\nCompany\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations required for operations.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as shown in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets.\n\nin thousands\nCash and cash equivalents\nRestricted cash\nRestricted cash included in \u201cOther non-current assets\u201d\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the statements of cash flows\n\nRestricted cash consisted of the following:\n\nin thousands\n\nCollateral for credit card program\nCollateral for outstanding bank guarantees\nCollateral for surety program included in \u201cOther non-current assets\u201d\nTotal restricted cash\n\nReceivables\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n345,896  $\n106,835 \n10,000 \n462,731  $\n\n357,296 \n62,425 \n10,000 \n429,721 \n\nSeptember 30,\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2,406  $\n\n104,429 \n10,000 \n116,835  $\n\n1,580 \n60,845 \n10,000 \n72,425 \n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and collections results in trade receivables, unbilled receivables and contract liabilities on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Trade receivables represent actual billings that are generally due within 30 days from the invoice date, and do not bear interest. Unbilled\nreceivables represent the excess of revenues recognized over billings to date on certain contracts. Receivables are carried at amounts billed, less any reserves\nfor  credit  losses,  if  any.  The  Company  periodically  assesses  collectability  of  accounts  receivable  and  records  an  expected  credit  loss  for  the  estimated\nuncollectible amount when deemed appropriate. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, reserve for credit losses was approximately $0.2 million and $0.1\nmillion respectively.\n\nAdvances are given to suppliers based on the contract terms of respective agreements and are presented on a separate line on the consolidated balance\n\nsheets. These advances are recovered through the receipt of goods and services mainly used in the production of energy storage products.\n \n\nLeases\n\n The  Company  leases  offices,  land,  warehouses,  and  equipment.  Leases  are  categorized  at  their  commencement  date  and  lease-related  assets  and\nliabilities are recognized for all leases with an initial term of 12 months or greater. The Company evaluates renewal options at commencement and on an\nongoing basis and includes options that are reasonably certain to exercise in its expected lease terms when classifying leases and measuring lease liabilities.\nThe Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of the lease payments over the lease term for leases, as these leases\ntypically do not have a stated borrowing rate. The Company\u2019s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive\ncovenants.\n\nEffective October 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (\"ASC 842\"), including the subsequent ASU's that amended and clarified the\nrelated guidance. Prior to the adoption of ASC 842, the Company accounted for leases under ASC 840 and recognized rent expense on a straight-line basis\nover the course of the lease term, which included any reasonably assured renewal periods, beginning on the date the Company took physical possession of\nthe property. The Company adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective approach, and accordingly the new guidance was applied to leases that existed\nor were entered into after October 1, 2021 without adjusting the comparative periods presented. Refer to \u201cNote 8 - Leases\u201d for a discussion of our updated\npolicies and disclosures related to leases.\n\n85\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Foreign Currency Transactions\n\nAn entity\u2019s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates and is generally the currency in which\nthe  entity  generates  and  expends  cash.  The  reporting  currency  of  the  Company  is  the  U.S.  dollar.  For  all  Fluence  subsidiary  entities  whose  functional\ncurrency is not in U.S. Dollar, the balance sheet and income statement are translated into US Dollar using the ending balance sheet rate and weighted\naverage rate, respectively. Translation adjustments are included as a separate component on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss), and\nin \u201cEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\u201d on the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nA business combination is an acquisition of a business from an entity not under common control and is accounted for using the acquisition method.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value\nof the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other net assets\nacquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Fair value measurements may require us to make significant estimates and\nassumptions. A measurement period, which could be up to one year from the date of the acquisition, exists to identify and measure the assets acquired and\nliabilities  assumed.  During  the  measurement  period,  provisional  amounts  may  be  recognized,  and  those  amounts  may  subsequently  be  prospectively\nadjusted  to  reflect  any  new  information  about  facts  and  circumstances  that  existed  at  the  acquisition  date  that,  if  known,  would  have  affected  the\nmeasurement of these amounts. At the end of the measurement period, any subsequent changes would not be recognized under the acquisition method but\nwould instead follow other accounting principles, which would generally impact earnings.\n\nCollaborative Arrangements\n\nUnder  ASC  808  Collaborative  Arrangements,  a  collaboration  arrangement  exists  when  the  parties,  who  are  active  participants  in  a  joint  operating\nactivity, are exposed to significant risks and rewards. In September 2020, Fluence entered into a Supply Agreement with a battery manufacturer to design,\ndevelop, manufacture and sell a lithium-ion battery module and related system. Under the agreement, Fluence has the right to further develop and sell\ncertain intellectual property that will be developed under the arrangement and owned by the manufacturer in exchange for royalty payments. Further, the\nmanufacturer has the right to further develop and sell certain intellectual property that will be developed and owned by Fluence in exchange for royalties\npayable to Fluence. Development costs paid by Fluence to the manufacturer are presented as \u201cResearch and development expenses.\u201d Purchases of batteries\nunder the Supply Agreement will be presented as \u201cInventory\u201d and \u201cCost of goods and services.\u201d Royalties payable to the manufacturer are due upon resale\nto customers and will be presented as \u201cCost of goods and services.\u201d Royalties due to Fluence will be presented as \u201cOther (Income) expense, net.\u201d Fluence\npaid  $1.2  million,  $1.9  million,  and  $3.5  million,  during  the  years  ended  September  30,  2023,  2022  and  2021,  respectively,  which  was  presented  as\n\u201cResearch & development expenses\u201d in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\nRevenue and Cost Recognition\n\nThe Company\u2019s revenue recognition policy included herein is based on the application of ASC 606. As of September 30, 2023, the Company\u2019s revenue\nwas generated primarily from sale of energy storage products and solutions, providing operational services related to energy storage products , and digital\napplications.\n\nRevenue from Sale of Energy Storage Products and Solutions: The Company enters into contracts with utility companies, developers, and commercial\nand industrial customers to design and build battery-based energy storage products. Each storage product is customized depending on the customer\u2019s energy\nneeds. Customer payments are due upon meeting certain milestones that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. The Company determines\nthe  transaction  price  based  on  the  consideration  expected  to  be  received  which  includes  estimates  of  liquidated  damages  (\u201cLDs\u201d)  or  other  variable\nconsideration that are included in the transaction price in accordance with ASC 606. We assess any variable consideration using an expected value method.\nThe transaction price identified is allocated to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service based on the relative standalone selling\nprices. Generally, the Company\u2019s contracts to design and build battery-based storage products are determined to have one performance obligation. When\nshipping and handling activities are performed after the customer obtains control of the product, we elect to account for shipping and handling as activities\nto fulfill the promise to transfer the product.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue over time as we transfer control of our product to the customer. This transfer of control to the customer is supported\nby clauses in the contracts, that provides enforceable rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date for products that do\nnot have an alternative use to the Company and/or as the project is built and control transfers depending on the contract terms.\n\n86\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Revenue for these performance obligations is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total\nestimated contract costs. Standard inventory materials (including batteries, enclosures, chillers, and others, which are assembled into \u201ccubes\u201d) that could be\nused  interchangeably  on  other  projects  are  included  in  our  measure  of  progress  when  they  are  integrated  into,  or  restricted  to,  the  production  of  the\ncustomer\u2019s project. Due to the significance of the costs associated with cubes, our judgement on when such costs should be included in the measure of\nprogress has a material impact on revenue recognition. Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs related to contract performance. Pre-contract\ncosts with no future benefit are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Since the revenue recognition of these contracts depends on estimates,\nwhich  are  assessed  continually  during  the  term  of  the  contract,  recognized  revenues  and  profit  are  subject  to  revisions  as  the  contract  progresses  to\ncompletion. The cumulative effects of revisions of estimated total contract costs and revenues, together with any contract reserves which may be deemed\nappropriate, are recorded in the period in which they occur. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that these\nestimates will be revised in a different period. When a loss is forecasted for a contract, the full amount of the anticipated loss is recognized in the period in\nwhich it is determined that a loss will occur. Refer to \u201cLoss Contracts\u201d below for further discussion.\n\nOur contracts generally provide our customers the right to liquidated damages against Fluence in the event specified milestones are not met on time, or\nequipment is not delivered according to contract specifications. Liquidated damages are accounted for as variable consideration, and the contract price is\nreduced by the expected penalty or LD amount when recognizing revenue. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that\nit is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Estimating variable\nconsideration requires certain estimates and assumptions, including whether and by how much a project will be delayed and/or will not meet performance\ncontractual  specifications.  The  existence  and  measurement  of  liquidated  damages  may  also  be  impacted  by  our  judgements  about  the  probability  of\nfavorable outcomes of customer disputes involving whether certain events qualify as force majeure or the reason for the events that caused project delays.\nVariable consideration for liquidated damages is estimated using the expected value of the consideration to be received.\n\nFluence  may  incur  additional  costs  to  execute  on  the  performance  of  a  contract.  When  this  happens,  we  typically  attempt  to  recover  the  revenue\nassociated with these costs via a change order with the customer. When this fact pattern occurs, it will create a timing difference between when we have\nincurred  the  cost  versus  when  we  record  the  revenue  as  costs  are  recognized  immediately  when  incurred  and  the  revenue  from  the  change  order  is\nrecognized as an increase to contract price when it is legally enforceable, which is usually upon signing a respective change order or equivalent document\nconfirming the claim acceptance by customer. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we recognized revenue of approximately $26.3 million, on\nprice increase change orders during the period in which the performance obligations were substantially satisfied in previous periods. Revenue is recorded\nnet of any taxes assessed on and collected from customers, which are remitted to the governmental authorities.\n\nFor our sale of energy storage products and solutions, services, and digital applications contracts where there are multiple performance obligations in a\nsingle contract or we sign separate contracts at or near the same time with the same customer that meet the criteria for combination, the Company allocates\nthe consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on\nestimated costs plus margin taking into consideration pricing history and market factors.\n\nRevenue from Services: The Company also enters into long-term service agreements with customers to provide operational services related to battery-\nbased energy storage products. The services include maintenance, monitoring, and other minor services. The Company accounts for the services as a single\nperformance obligation as the services are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customers. We typically recognize revenue\novertime using a straight-line recognition method for these types of services. The Company believes using a time-based method to measure progress is\nappropriate as the performance obligations are satisfied evenly over time based on the fact that customers receive the services evenly. Revenue is recognized\nby dividing the total transaction price over the service period.\n\nSome  of  the  agreements  also  provide  a  commitment  to  perform  augmentation  activities  which  would  typically  be  represented  by  installation  of\nadditional batteries, and other components as needed, to compensate for partially lost capacity due to degradation of batteries over time. The obligation to\nperform augmentation activities can take the form of either maintaining battery capacity above a given threshold for a stated term while others provide a\nfixed  number  of  augmentations  over  a  contract  term.  Augmentation  arrangements  that  require  us  to  maintain  battery  capacity  above  an  established\nthresholds for a given term may be considered service-type warranties depending on the contract terms . These represent a stand-ready obligation in which\nthe  customer  benefits  evenly  overtime,  of  which  we  recognize  revenue  for  these  arrangements  using  a  straight-line  recognition  method.  Alternatively,\naugmentation arrangements that require us to perform a fixed number of augmentations over a contract term follow the percentage of completion revenue\nrecognition method. Since these arrangements require a fixed number of augmentations we must perform, we use the pattern of cost as a proxy to identify\nwhen our obligations are satisfied and to recognize revenue.\n\n87\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Revenue from Digital Applications: The Company provides access to proprietary cloud-based Software-as-a-Service through the Fluence IQ platform.\nThe Fluence IQ platform currently includes Fluence Mosaic and Fluence Nispera. Fluence Mosaic is an intelligent bidding software for utility-scale storage\nand  renewable  assets,  enabling  customers  to  optimize  asset  trading  in  wholesale  electricity  markets.  Fluence  Mosaic  is  currently  available  in  the  NEM\n(Australia), CAISO (California), and ERCOT (Texas) markets. Fluence Nispera is our asset performance management (APM) software, which we acquired\nin  2022.  Fluence  Nispera  helps  customers  monitor,  analyze,  forecast,  and  optimize  the  performance  and  value  of  renewable  energy  assets.  Its  flagship\noffering is an AI-driven utility-scale asset performance management platform that supports portfolios of energy storage, solar, and wind assets. Customers\ndo not receive legal title or ownership of the applications as a result of these arrangements. The use of the Fluence IQ platform is separately identifiable\nfrom other promises that the Company offers to its customers (i.e., it is not highly interrelated or integrated with other solutions). As such, we determined\nthat the Fluence IQ platform is accounted for as a separate performance obligation when combined with other products and services. We consider access to\nthe platform and related support services in a customer contract to be a series of distinct services which comprise a single performance obligation because\nthey are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. We recognize revenue over time using a straight-line recognition method.\n\nCost of Goods and Services: Cost of goods and services consists primarily of product costs, including purchased materials and supplies, as well as costs\nrelated to shipping, customer support, product warranty and personnel. Personnel costs in cost of goods and services includes both direct labor costs as well\nas  costs  attributable  to  any  individuals  whose  activities  relate  to  the  transformation  of  raw  materials  or  component  parts  into  finished  goods  or  the\ntransportation of materials to the customer. Cost of goods and services are recognized when services are performed, or control of goods are transferred to the\ncustomers,  which  is  generally  based  upon  International  Commercial  Terms  (commonly  referred  to  as  \u2018\u2018incoterms\u2019\u2019)  stated  in  corresponding  supply\nagreements or purchase orders. Standard inventory materials that could be used interchangeably on other projects are included in cost of goods sold when\nthey are integrated into, or restricted to, the production of the customer\u2019s project.\n\nDeferred Revenue: Deferred revenue represents the excess billings to date over the amount of revenue recognized to date. Contract advances represent\namounts received by the Company upon signing of the related contracts with customers. The advances are offset proportionately against progress billings.\nAny outstanding portion is included in deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\nLoss Contracts: A contract becomes a loss contract when its estimated total costs are expected to exceed its total revenue. The Company accrues the\nfull loss expected in the period a loss contract is identified which is recorded in \u201cCurrent liabilities \u2014 Accruals and provisions\u201d and \u201cCost of goods and\nservices\u201d on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, respectively.\n\nInventory, Net\n\nInventory  consists  of  batteries  and  equipment,  enclosures,  inverters,  and  spare  parts  which  are  used  in  ongoing  battery  storage  projects  for  sale.\nInventory  is  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net  realizable  value  with  cost  being  determined  by  the  specific  identification  method.  Costs  include  cost  of\npurchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The Company periodically reviews\nits inventory for potential obsolescence and write down of its inventory, as appropriate, to net realizable value based on its\u2019 assessment of usefulness and\nmarketability conditions.\n \n\nSoftware Development Costs\n\nOur  software  development  costs  primarily  relate  to  two  categories:  1)  internal-use  software  development  costs,  and  2)  external-use  software\n\ndevelopment costs. We capitalize costs incurred to purchase or develop software for internal use, and software to be sold or leased externally.\n\nInternal-use  software  development  costs  are  capitalized  during  the  application  development  stage  in  accordance  with  ASC  350-40,  Internal-Use\nSoftware. These capitalized costs are reflected in \u201cIntangible Assets, Net\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the estimated useful\nlife of the software. Our internal-use software relates to our SaaS customer offerings and is amortized to cost of goods and services. The useful life of our\ninternal-use software development costs is generally 3 years.\n\nDuring  the  fiscal  years  ended  September  30,  2023  and  2022,  the  Company  capitalized  $6.4  million  and  $0.0  million,  respectively,  of  internal  use\n\nsoftware.\n\nExternal-use software development costs developed to be sold or leased externally are capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility for\na product in accordance with ASC 985-20, Software to be Sold or Leased Externally. These software development costs are reflected in \u201cIntangible Assets,\nNet\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized to cost of goods and services on a product basis by the greater of the straight-line method over the\nestimated economic life of the product, or the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues\nfor that product. The useful life of our external-use software development costs is generally 5 years.\n\n88\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##During  the  fiscal  years  ended  September  30,  2023  and  2022,  the  Company  capitalized  $3.3  million  and  $0.0  million,  respectively,  of  external-use\n\nsoftware.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of its property and equipment, and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The assets are considered impaired when their future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying\nvalue and fair value is less than their carrying value. Impairment charges are calculated as the difference between the discounted expected future cash flows,\nor other accepted valuation techniques to determine fair value and the assets\u2019 carrying amount at the date of the triggering event.\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nIntangible assets are stated at their historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. Intangible assets are reviewed\n\nfor impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\n\nSupply Chain Financing\n\nWe have provided certain of our suppliers with access to a supply chain financing program through a third-party financing institution (the \u201cSCF Bank\u201d).\nThis program allows us to seek extended payment terms with our suppliers, and allows our suppliers to monetize their receivables prior to the payment due\ndate, subject to a discount. Once a supplier elects to participate in the program and reaches an agreement with the SCF Bank, the supplier elects which\nindividual invoices to sell to the SCF Bank. We then pay the SCF Bank on the invoice due date. We have no economic interest in a supplier\u2019s decision to sell\na receivable to the SCF Bank. The agreements between our suppliers and the SCF Bank are solely at their discretion and are negotiated directly between\nthem. Our suppliers\u2019 ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of our financial condition and guarantees issued by\nAES and Siemens. As of September 30, 2023, AES and Siemens issued guarantees of $50 million each, for a total of $100 million, to the SCF Bank on our\nbehalf.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, three suppliers were actively participating in the supply chain financing program, and we had $30.0 million of payables\noutstanding subject to the program. All outstanding payments owed under the program are recorded within \u201cAccounts payable\u201d in our Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\n\nAccruals and Provisions\n\nExpenses are recognized on an accrual basis. Provisions are recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of liability\n\ncould be reasonably estimated.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses include research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization.\nResearch  and  development  expenses  represent  personnel  costs  of  the  development  team,  and  costs  of  materials  and  services  procured  for  research  and\ndevelopment projects. Sales and marketing expenses represent personnel costs of the sales team and all marketing expenses. General and administrative\nexpenses represent personnel costs, rent, IT expenses insurance, and external providers for payroll, accounting, consulting, and others. Depreciation and\namortization are expenses associated with property and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nAdvertising Costs\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1.4 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million for the years ended September 30,\n\n2023, 2022 and 2021 respectively.\n\nEarnings (Loss) per Share\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company has three classes of common stock, Class A, Class B-1 and Class B-2. Earnings per share is calculated and\nreported under the \u201ctwo-class\u201d method. The \u201ctwo-class\u201d method is an earnings allocation method under which loss per share is calculated for each class of\ncommon  stock  considering  both  distributions  declared  or  accumulated  and  participation  rights  in  undistributed  earnings  as  if  all  such  loss  had  been\ndistributed during the period.\n\nBasic net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Class A common stockholders by the weighted\naverage number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by\nadjusting the net loss available to Class A common stockholders and the weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding to give effect to\npotentially dilutive securities. Shares of our Class B-1 and Class B-2 common\n\n89\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##stock are not entitled to receive any distributions or dividends. When a common unit of Fluence Energy, LLC is redeemed for cash or Class A common\nstock by a Founder who holds shares of our Class B-1 or Class B-2 common stock, such Founder will be required to surrender a share of Class B-1 or Class\nB-2 common stock, as the case may be, which we will cancel for no consideration. In the event of cash settlement, the Company is required to issue new\nshares of Class A common stock and use the proceeds from the sale of these newly-issued shares of Class A common stock to fully fund the cash settlement.\nTherefore, we did not include shares of our Class B-1 or Class B-2 common stock in the computation of basic loss per share. As we have incurred losses for\nall periods presented, diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share because the effect of potentially dilutive securities would be antidilutive.\n\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive securities that were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share:\n\nClass B-1 common stock\nOutstanding non-qualified stock options\nOutstanding phantom units\nOutstanding restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d)\nOutstanding restricted stock units (\u201cNispera\u201d)\n\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n58,586,695 \n5,351,585 \n256,935 \n1,843,570 \n354,134 \n\n58,586,695 \n8,923,121 \n605,591 \n2,156,893 \n531,202 \n\nIn October 2021, the existing limited liability company agreement of Fluence Energy, LLC was amended and restated which recapitalized all existing\ninterests  in  the  Company  on  the  basis  of  a  14.79-for-1  split.

Foreign subsidiaries of the Company account for income taxes and the related accounts in accordance with ASC 740,\nIncome Taxes. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets\nand liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.\n\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by\n\nthe taxing authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n\nThe  preparation  of  income  tax  returns  requires  the  use  of  management\u2019s  estimates  and  interpretations  which  may  be  subjected  to  review  by  the\n\nrespective taxing authorities and may result in an assessment of additional taxes, penalties, and interest.\n\n90\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities reflects management\u2019s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in\nconnection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nto minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The following fair value hierarchy, defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, is used to classify assets and\nliabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used to value the assets and liabilities:\n\nLevel 1\u2014Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which\n\ntransactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nLevel 2\u2014Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the\nreporting date. Level 2 inputs include those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily\nindustry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted prices, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices\nfor  the  underlying  instruments,  as  well  as  other  relevant  economic  measures.  Substantially  all  of  these  assumptions  are  observable  in  the  marketplace\nthroughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in\nthe marketplace.\n\nLevel 3\u2014Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally\ndeveloped methodologies that result in management\u2019s best estimate of fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The Company does not have\nany recurring Level 3 fair value measurements.\n\nThe Company\u2019s cash equivalents include term deposits with original maturity of less than three months and are recorded at amortized cost. Fair value of\ncash  equivalents  approximates  the  carrying  amount.  The  carrying  amounts  of  trade  receivables,  accounts  payable  and  short-term  debt  obligations\napproximate fair values due to their short maturities.\n\nShort-term  Investments  and  Marketable  Securities:  We  obtain  pricing  from  level  1  inputs  which  includes  information  from  quoted  market  prices,\npricing vendors or quotes from brokers/dealers. We conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendors to determine whether the inputs used in the vendor\u2019s\npricing processes are deemed to be observable. The fair value of U.S. Treasury securities and government-related securities, corporate bonds and notes and\ncommon stock is generally determined using standard observable inputs, including reported trades, quoted market prices, matrix pricing, benchmark yields,\nbroker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets and/or benchmark securities. Marketable securities are presented on the balance sheets at fair value\nat the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities is included in \u201cOther (income) expense, net\u201d\nin the accompanying statements of operations.

In  addition,  the  Company\u2019s\ncustomers have the right, under some circumstances, to terminate contracts or defer the timing of its services and their payments to the Company.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had $2.9 billion of remaining performance obligations related to our contractual commitments, of which we\n\nexpect to recognize in revenue approximately 60% to 65% in the next 12 months, with the remainder recognized in revenue in periods thereafter.\nVariable consideration\n\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, our transaction prices have been reduced to reflect variable consideration of $84.1 million and $75.5 million,\nrespectively. Variable consideration primarily relates to our customers\u2019 rights to liquidated damages in the event a specified milestone has not been met or\nequipment  is  not  delivered  to  contract  specifications.  Variable  consideration  is  estimated  using  the  expected-value  method  which  computes  a  weighted\naverage  amount  based  on  a  range  of  potential  outcomes.  In  contracts  in  which  a  significant  reversal  may  occur,  we  constrain  the  amount  of  revenue\nrecognized based on our estimations using the expected-value method.\n\n94\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##4.

Nispera\u2019s advanced technology helps customers monitor, analyze, forecast, and optimize the performance and value of renewable\nenergy assets. The preliminary base purchase price for the acquisition was $33.4 million, of which $27.1 million was paid in cash to investors, $2.6 million\nwas paid to debt holders at the purchase date, and $3.7 million will be paid to investors 18 months from date of purchase. In addition, Fluence issued\n0.5 million shares of restricted stock to Nispera\u2019s management team that vest ratably over three years for retention purposes and is accounted for as stock\ncompensation The acquisition represents a business combination under ASC 805 Business Combinations.

Leases\n\n10 years\n5 years\n5 years\n10 years, or lease term if shorter\n2 years\n\nOn October 1, 2021 the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (\"ASC 842\") including the subsequent ASU's that amended and clarified the related\nguidance. ASC 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract\ninception. A lease exists when a contract conveys to the customer the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for\nconsideration. The definition of a lease embodies two conditions: (1) there is an identified asset in the contract, and (2) the customer has the right to control\nthe  use  of  the  identified  asset.  Lessees  are  required  to  classify  leases  as  either  finance  or  operating  leases.  This  classification  will  determine\nwhether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nASC 842 provided several optional practical expedients for use in transition to and ongoing application of ASC 842. The Company elected to utilize the\npackage of practical expedients in ASC 842-10-65-1(f) that, upon adoption of ASC 842, allows entities to (1) not reassess whether any expired or existing\ncontracts are or contain leases, (2) retain the classification of leases (e.g., operating or finance lease) existing as of the date of adoption and (3) not reassess\ninitial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company did not elect the practical expedient pertaining to the use of hindsight. For all asset classes which\nthe Company currently has leases, the\n\n96\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Company elected to utilize the practical expedient in ASC 842-10-15-37 in which the Company has chosen to account for each separate lease component of\na contract and its associated non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\nThe  Company\u2019s  right-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities  primarily  relate  to  offices,  land,  warehouses,  and  equipment.  The  Company\u2019s  leases  have\nremaining  lease  terms  of  one  year  to  three  years.  The  Company's  leases  are  all  classified  as  operating  leases.  Certain  of  the  Company\u2019s  leases  contain\nrenewal, extension, or termination options. The Company assesses each option on an individual basis and will only include options reasonably certain of\nexercise in the lease term. The Company generally considers the base term to be the term provided in the contract. None of the Company\u2019s lease agreements\ncontain material options to purchase the leased property, material residual value guarantees, or material restrictions or covenants.\n\nThe Company does not recognize a lease liability or right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for short-term leases. Instead, the Company recognizes\nshort-term lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. A short-term lease is defined as a lease that, at the commencement date,\nhas a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. Leases\n(with terms greater than twelve months) are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid. As\nthe Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for\ncollateralized  borrowing  over  a  similar  term  of  the  lease  payments  at  commencement  date  to  calculate  the  present  value  of  future  lease  payments.\nCertain leases include payments that are based solely on an index or rate. These variable lease payments are included in the calculation of the ROU asset\nand lease liability and are initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date. Other variable lease payments, such as payments based\non  use  and  for  property  taxes,  insurance,  or  common  area  maintenance  that  are  based  on  actual  assessments  are  excluded  from  the  ROU  asset\nand lease liability and are expensed as incurred. In addition to the present value of the future lease payments, the calculation of the ROU asset also includes\nadjustments for lease incentives, deferred rent, lease prepayments and initial direct costs of obtaining the lease, such as commissions.\n\nCertain lease contracts contain nonlease components such as maintenance and utilities.

Debt\n\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn November 1, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement for a revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolver\u201d), by and among Fluence Energy, LLC, as the\nborrower, Fluence Energy, Inc., as a parent guarantor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as\nadministrative agent and collateral agent (the \u201cRevolving Credit Agreement\u201d). The Revolver is secured by a (i) first priority pledge of the equity securities\nof Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries and (ii) first priority security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal\nproperty and material fee-owned real property of Fluence Energy, LLC, the parent guarantor and each subsidiary guarantor party thereto, in each case,\nsubject to customary exceptions and limitations. The initial aggregate amount of commitments was $190.0 million from the lenders party thereto including\nJP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, and five other banks. On June 30, 2022,\nthe Company increased the revolving commitment available under the Revolver by $10.0 million to an aggregate of $200.0 million with the addition of UBS\nAG, Stamford Branch as an additional lender under the Revolver. The maturity date of the Revolver is November 1, 2025. On May 19, 2023 the Revolving\nCredit Agreement was amended to replace Adjusted LIBOR with Adjusted Term SOFR as the applicable benchmark interest rate with respect to certain\nclasses of loans. The Company elected the optional practical expedient as it related to our Revolver as the amendment did not modify terms that change or\nhave the potential to change, the amount and timing of cash flows unrelated to the replacement of LIBOR.\n\nThe Revolver bears interest at (i) with respect to Term Benchmark Loans (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), the Adjusted Term SOFR\nRate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate or the AUD Rate (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), as applicable, plus 3.0%, (ii) with respect to\nABR Loans (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus 2.0%, or (iii) with\nrespect to RFR Loans (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), the applicable Daily Simply RFR (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement)\nplus 3.1193%, in each instance subject to customary benchmark replacement provisions including, but not limited to, alternative benchmark rates, customary\nspread adjustments with respect to borrowings in foreign currency and benchmark replacement conforming changes. Fluence Energy, LLC is required to pay\nto the lenders a commitment fee of 0.55% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving commitments through maturity, which will be the\nfour-year anniversary of the closing date of the Revolver. The Revolver also provides for up to $200.0 million in letter of credit issuances, which required\ncustomary issuance and administration fees, as well as a fronting fee payable to each issuer thereof and a letter of credit participation fee of 2.75% per\nannum payable to the lenders.\n\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary covenants for these types of financing, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict our\nability to incur additional indebtedness; incur liens; sell, transfer, or dispose of property and assets; make investments or acquisitions; make dividends,\ndistributions or other restricted payments; and engage in affiliate transactions. The Revolving Credit Agreement limits our ability to make certain payments,\nincluding dividends and distributions on Fluence Energy, LLC\u2019s equity, Fluence Energy, Inc.\u2019s equity and other restricted payments. Under the terms of the\nRevolving Credit Agreement, Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries are currently limited in their ability to pay cash dividends to, lend to, or make other\ninvestments in Fluence Energy, Inc., subject to certain exceptions, including among others (i) the ability to make investments of up to the greater of (a)\n$10,500,000 and (b) 1.5% of the consolidated assets of Fluence Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and (ii) the ability to issue dividends and make other\nRestricted Payments (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) (a) if after giving pro forma effect to such dividend or other Restricted Payment the\nTotal Liquidity (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) of Fluence Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries party to the Revolving Credit Agreement is at\nleast $600,000,000, (b) such dividend or other Restricted Payment is made to reimburse Fluence Energy, Inc. for certain tax distributions under the Third\nAmended  and  Restated  Limited  Liability  Company  Agreement  of  Fluence  Energy,  LLC  (the  \u201cLLC  Agreement\u201d)  and  certain  payments  under  the  Tax\nReceivable Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2021, entered into connection with the IPO, by and among Fluence Energy, Inc., Fluence Energy, LLC and\nthe Founders (the \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d) and certain operational expenses incurred in connection with the ownership and management of Fluence\nEnergy, LLC.\n\nIn addition, we are required to maintain (i) minimum liquidity and gross revenue requirements, in each case, until consolidated EBITDA reaches $150.0\nmillion for the most recent four fiscal quarters and we made an election, and (ii) thereafter, a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage\nratio. Such covenants were tested on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all such covenants or maintained availability\nabove such covenant triggers.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had no borrowings under the Revolver and $35.9 million of letters of credit outstanding, and availability under the\n\nfacility was $164.1 million net of letters of credit issued.\n\nLine of Credit\nPrior to the IPO, the Company had an Uncommitted Line of Credit Agreement (\u201cLine of Credit\u2019) with Citibank, N.A. (\u201cCitibank\u201d) which allowed us to\nborrow an amount in aggregate not to exceed $50.0 million, with the expiration date on March 31, 2023. Outstanding borrowings from the Line of Credit\nwere $50.0 million as of September 30, 2021. The weighted average annual interest rate of the borrowing was 2.83%. On November 1, 2021, the $50.0\nmillion outstanding borrowings from the Line of Credit was paid off using the proceeds from our IPO and the Line of Credit was canceled shortly thereafter.\n\n98\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Borrowings Against Note Receivable - Pledged as Collateral\nIn  December  2022,  we  transferred  $24.3  million  in  customer  receivables  to  Standard  Chartered  Bank  (\u201cSCB\u201d)  in  the  Philippines  for  proceeds  of\n$21.1 million. The receivables all related to our largest customer in that country. The underlying receivables transferred were previously aggregated into a\nlong  term  note,  with  interest,  and  has  a  maturity  date  of  September  30,  2024  and  was  previously  classified  under  \u201cOther  non-current  assets\u201d  on  our\nconsolidated balance sheet. In April 2023, we aggregated into an additional long term note and transferred an additional $30.9 million in receivables with\nthe  same  customer  to  SCB  for  proceeds  of  $27.0  million,  upon  substantially  similar  terms  as  the  December  2022  transfer  and  has  a  maturity  date  of\nDecember 27, 2024. These transactions are treated as secured borrowings as we did not transfer the entire note receivables due from the customer to SCB.\nWe continue to receive quarterly interest income from the customer, while SCB is responsible for collecting payments on the principal balances which\nrepresent the initial receivable balances from the customer. We have no other continuing involvement or exposure related to the underlying receivables. As\nof September 30, 2023, we recorded a net interest income of $1.0 million, which represents the aggregate of $3.4 million in interest income recorded in\n\u201cInterest (income) expense, net\u201d and $2.4 million in interest expense.\n\nRefer to \u201cNote 15 - Related-Party Transactions\u201d for borrowing from related parties\n\n13.

Approximately $25.1 million of the foreign net operating losses will expire between fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2031. The federal and state\nnet  operating  loss  carryforwards  as  of  September  30,  2023  and  September  30,  2022  are  approximately  $182.2  million  ($107.1  million  federal  and\n$75.1 million state) and $184.4 million ($105.8 million federal and $78.6 million state), respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards\nare attributable to Fluence Energy, Inc. a corporate entity which, upon IPO on November 1, 2021, became a holding company of Fluence Energy, LLC. The\nfederal net operating losses have an unlimited carryforward period. Approximately $63.4 million of state net operating losses will expire between fiscal year\n2032 and fiscal year 2043.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had recorded a valuation allowance of $371.7 million and $354.4 million, respectively. In 2022, the\nvaluation allowances were recorded against deferred tax assets of the Company\u2019s German and Australian subsidiaries, as well as Fluence Energy, Inc. In\n2023,  the  valuation  allowances  were  recorded  against  deferred  tax  assets  of  the  Company\u2019s  subsidiaries  in  Germany,  Australia,  Philippines,  Singapore,\nNetherlands, United Kingdom, as well as Fluence Energy, Inc. As a holding company, Fluence Energy, Inc. recorded deferred tax assets primarily related to\nits investment in the LLC. The Company determined that based on the weight of available evidence, including cumulative losses, it is more-likely-than-not\nthat the net deferred tax assets at Fluence Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries in Germany, Australia, Philippines, Singapore, Netherlands, and United Kingdom,\nwill not be realized and recorded a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets.\n\nThe net increase in the valuation allowance of $17.3 million in fiscal year 2023 is due to a $9.0 million increase recorded through equity, a $6.8 million\nincrease in valuation allowance related to current year activity in jurisdictions with full valuation allowances, and a $1.4 million increase related to currency\ntranslation adjustments. Further, a future reversal of $2.8 million of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2023, would be\naccounted for as an increase in equity. For fiscal year 2022, the net increase in the valuation allowance was $342.8 million.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits. All tax jurisdictions remain subject to examination\nby  foreign,  federal,  and  state  taxing  authorities  with  the  exception  of  Germany  for  the  tax  periods  2018  to  2020  for  which  the  entity  was  issued  a\nCancellation Reservation of Review, which permanently closed these periods for audit.

The Company recognizes revenue for service- type\n\nwarranties using a straight-line approach.\n\nThe Company provides a limited warranty related to the successful operation of battery-based energy storage solutions, apart from the service type\nwarranties described above and are normally provided for a limited period of time from one to five years, after the commercial operation date or substantial\ncompletion depending on the contract terms. The warranties are considered assurance-type warranties which provide a guarantee of quality of the products.\nFor assurance-type warranties, the Company records an estimate of future warranty cost over the period of construction, consistent with transfer of control\nand revenue recognition on the equipment or battery-based energy storage products. Furthermore, we accrue the estimated liability cost of specific reserves\nor  recalls  when  they  are  probable  and  estimable  if  identified.  Warranty  expense  is  recorded  as  a  component  of  \u201cCosts  of  goods  and  services\u201d  in  the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\n\nOur assurance type warranties are often backed by supplier covered warranties for major equipment (OEM) such as batteries and inverters, which is\nincluded in our estimated warranty liability. We record a corresponding asset for a portion of the warranty cost covered by the supplier warranty due to the\nfact  that  the  contracts  are  enforceable,  the  suppliers  are  financially  viable,  and  we  have  a  history  of  satisfying  claims  with  our  suppliers.  The  asset  is\nrecorded with in \u201cOther current assets\u201d and \u201cOther non-current assets\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company accrued the below estimated warranty liabilities, respectively.\n\nIn thousands\nWarranty balance, beginning\nWarranties issued and assumed in period\nChange in estimates\nChange in balance sheet presentation\nNet changes in liability for warranty expirations, costs incurred, and foreign exchange\nimpact\nWarranty balance, ending\nLess: Recoverable warranty costs from suppliers\nWarranty balance, net of recoverable warranty costs from suppliers, at end of period\n\n$\n\n$\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n1,625  $\n12,168 \n8,288 \n10,307 \n\n(5,479)\n26,909 \n10,307 \n16,602  $\n\n\u2014 \n1,625 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n1,625 \n\u2014 \n1,625 \n\nEffective March 31, 2023, the Company updated its estimation model for calculating the recurring warranty reserve rate, which is a key input into our\nestimated assurance warranty liability. We then subsequently updated the presentation effective September 30, 2023, to present the full warranty liability and\nrecord a corresponding asset for recoverable warranty costs from suppliers.\n\nThe key inputs and assumptions used by us to estimate our warranty liability are: (1) the number of units expected to fail or be replaced over time (i.e.,\nfailure rate); and (2) the per unit cost of replacement, including shipping, labor costs, and costs for equipment necessary for repair or replacement that are\nexpected  to  be  incurred  to  replace  or  repair  failed  units  over  time  (i.e.,  repair  or  replacement  cost).  Our  Safety  and  Quality  department  has  primary\nresponsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of product.\n\nThe key inputs and assumptions used in calculating the estimated assurance warranty liability are reviewed by management on as needed basis. We may\nmake  additional  adjustments  to  the  estimated  assurance  warranty  liability  based  on  our  comparison  of  actual  warranty  results  to  expected  results  for\nsignificant differences or based on performance trends or other qualitative factors. If actual failure rates, or replacement costs differ from our estimates in\nfuture periods, changes to these estimates may be required, resulting in increases or decreases in our estimated assurance warranty liability which may be\nmaterial. As we are in an evolving market there is a degree of estimation uncertainty regarding our estimated recurring warranty accrual rate.\n\nLegal Contingencies\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims that arise out of our operations and businesses and that cover a wide\nrange of matters, including, among others, intellectual property matters, contract and employment claims, personal injury claims, product liability claims\nand warranty claims. The Company accrues for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be\nreasonably estimated. It is reasonably possible that some\n\n102\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be\nmaterial. The following discusses certain potential loss contingencies as of September 30, 2023:\n\n2021 Overheating Event at Customer Facility\n\nOn September 4, 2021, a 300 MW energy storage facility owned by one of our customers experienced an overheating event. Fluence served as the\nenergy storage technology provider designed and installed portions of the facility, which was completed in fiscal year 2021. No injuries were reported from\nthe  incident.  The  facility  was  taken  offline  as  teams  from  Fluence,  our  customer,  and  the  battery  designer/manufacturer  investigated  the  incident.  Our\ncustomer released initial findings in the second fiscal quarter of 2022 on what it contends is the root cause of the incident. At this time, Fluence cannot\ncomment on or accept the customer\u2019s stated findings. The customer\u2019s stated findings, if ultimately confirmed and proven, could relate to certain scopes of\nwork for which Fluence or its subcontractors could be responsible. The customer\u2019s stated findings, however, could also relate to certain scopes of work for\nwhich other parties were responsible and/or relate to other causes, including the design and installation of portions of the facility over which Fluence did not\nhave responsibility or control. The customer has alleged that Fluence is liable for the incident but has not yet demanded a specific amount of compensation\nnor alleged a particular level of responsibility. Fluence has denied liability. No formal legal proceedings have been commenced, but it is reasonably possible\nthat  litigation  may  result  from  this  matter  if  a  resolution  cannot  be  achieved.  Any  such  dispute  would  also  likely  include  claims  by  Fluence  and\ncounterclaims by the customer relating to disputed costs arising from the original design and construction of the facility. The customer announced in July of\n2022 that a large portion of the facility was back online. We are currently not able to estimate the impact, that this incident may have on our financial results.\nTo date, we do not believe that this incident has impacted the market\u2019s adoption of our products.\n\n2022 Overheating Event at Customer Facility\n\nOn April 18, 2022, a 10 MW energy storage facility in Chandler, Arizona owned by AES experienced an overheating event. Fluence served as the\nenergy storage technology provider for the facility, which was completed in 2019, and Fluence previously provided maintenance services for the facility.\nThere were no injuries. The facility has been taken offline as teams from Fluence, AES, and the battery manufacturer continue to investigate the incident.\nWe are currently not able to estimate the impact, if any, that this incident may have on our reputation or financial results, or on market adoption of our\nproducts.\n\n2023 Project-Related Litigation\n\nIn October 2023, Fluence filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California, Contra Costa County, against Diablo Energy Storage, LLC, Empire\nBusiness Park, LLC, the Bank of New York Mellon and others, seeking approximately $37.0 million in damages arising from the supply and construction of\nan energy storage facility for the defendants. On or about November 10, 2023, Defendant Diablo Energy Storage, LLC filed a cross-complaint against\nFluence, seeking a minimum of $25.0 million of alleged damages and disgorgement of all compensation received by Fluence for the project, in the amount\nof approximately $230.0 million. Fluence denies the allegations in the cross-complaint and intends to vigorously defend against them and to enforce our\nclaims against the defendants. We are currently not able to estimate the impact, if any, that this litigation may have on our reputation or financial results, or\non market adoption of our products.\n\n15. Related-Party Transactions\n\nRelated parties are represented by AES and Siemens, their respective subsidiaries and other entities under common control. As of September 30, 2023,\nAES holds 58,586,695 shares of Class B-1 common stock of Fluence Energy, Inc. and Siemens holds an aggregate of 58,586,695 shares of Class A common\nstock of Fluence Energy, Inc.\n\nCapital Contributions from Members\n\nIn June 2021, Siemens made a $6.3 million capital contribution in cash to the Company in exchange for certain amendments to the Company\u2019s limited\n\nliability company agreement.\n\nBorrowings from Related Parties\n\nOn August 11, 2021, the Company borrowed $25.0 million each from AES and Siemens, in the form of subordinated promissory notes, each bearing\ninterest at 2.86% per annum. The promissory notes were paid off in full on November 1, 2021 using proceeds from the IPO. All related party borrowings\nwere for general working capital needs. There were no new related party borrowings during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n\nSales and Procurement Contracts with Related Parties\n\nThe  Company  signs  back-to-back  battery-based  energy  storage  product  and  related  service  contracts  with  AES,  Siemens,  and  their  subsidiaries\n(collectively referred to as affiliates) in relation to execution of the affiliates\u2019 contracts with external customers and also signs direct contracts with affiliates.\n\n103\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##The  Company  also  provides  consulting  services  to  AES  whereby  Fluence  will  advise  and  in  some  cases  provide  support  to  AES  on  procurement,\nlogistics, design, safety and commissioning of certain of their projects. Revenue from consulting services is classified as \u201cRevenue from sale of energy\nstorage products and solutions\u201d in the Company\u2019s disaggregation of revenue table in \u201cNote 3 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d Revenue from the\nconsulting  services  is  primarily  recognized  ratably  over  time  based  on  a  project  specific  period  of  performance  in  which  we  expect  the  performance\nobligation to be fulfilled. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we have recognized $12.3 million in revenue from consulting services with related\nparties.\n\nRevenue  from  contracts  with  affiliates  is  included  in  \u201cRevenue  from  related  parties\u201d  on  the  Company\u2019s  consolidated  statements  of  operations  and\n\ncomprehensive loss.\n\nIn addition, the Company purchases materials and supplies from its affiliates and records the costs in \u201cCost of goods and services\u201d on the Company\u2019s\n\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\nService Agreements with Affiliates\n\nFluence and its affiliates have signed service agreements under which the affiliates provide certain management and administrative services to Fluence.\nThe services include but are not limited to, treasury, information technology services, sales services, and research and development. Cost of services are\naccrued  monthly  and  included  in  \u201cPayables  and  deferred  revenue  with  related  parties\u201d,  and  \u201cGeneral  and  administrative\u201d,  \u201cSales  and  marketing\u201d,  or\n\u201cResearch and development\u201d on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations and comprehensive loss, respectively.\n\nContract Performance Guarantees\n\nFluence paid performance guarantee fees to its affiliates in exchange for guaranteeing Fluence\u2019s performance obligations under certain contracts with\nFluence\u2019s  customers,  which  are  based  on  the  affiliates\u2019  weighted  average  cost  for  bank  guarantees  and  their  per  annum  cost  of  surety  bonds  with  a\nreasonable  markup.

The  401(k)  plan  provides  that  eligible  employees  may  make\ncontributions subject to IRS limitations. Under terms of the 401(k) plan, the Company matches an employee\u2019s contributions at a rate of 100% up to 5% of\nthe employee\u2019s annual eligible earnings as defined in the 401(k) plan. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company contributed\napproximately $5.0 million and $4.1 million to the 401(k) plan, respectively.\n\n17. Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Option Plan\n\nIn  2020,  the  Company  established  the  2020  Unit  Option  Plan  (the  \u201cOption  Plan\u201d)  whereby  employees,  directors,  and  consultants,  were  originally\ngranted non-qualified options to purchase Class A-1 units of Fluence Energy, LLC. As of September 30, 2021, the Company determined that achievement of\nthe  performance  conditions  related  to  awards  granted  under  the  Option  Plan  was  not  probable  and  therefore,  no  expense  was  recognized  for  the  non-\nqualified  options  during  the  fiscal  year  ended  September  30,  2021.  The  completion  of  the  IPO  on  November  1,  2021  resulted  in  achievement  of  the\nperformance condition for the majority of the underlying awards granted under the Option Plan. In connection with the IPO, the non-qualified options were\nconverted into non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Class A common stock of Fluence Energy, Inc. Non-qualified stock options under the\nOption Plan have a contractual term of ten years from the date of grant. The Company estimated the fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option-\npricing model. The outstanding awards will continue to be governed by the terms of the existing Option Plan. The Option Plan is accounted for as an equity\nplan. We do not expect to make any further awards under the Option Plan.\n\nThe following table summarizes the unit option activity under the Option Plan:\n\nOutstanding as of October 1, 2022\nExercised\nForfeited\nOutstanding and exercisable as of September 30, 2023\n\nNumber of options\n\nWeighted average\n\nexercise price per share\n2.45 \n2.45\n2.45\n2.45 \n\n8,923,121  $\n(2,997,888)\n(573,648)\n5,351,585  $\n\nWeighted average\n\nremaining contractual\n\nterm (years)\n\n8.51\n\n7.51\n\nThe total intrinsic value of the stock options outstanding under the Option Plan during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 was $109.9 million.\nTotal compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized as of September 30, 2023 totaled $0.2 million, and is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted average period of 0.5 years.\n\nThe total intrinsic value of the stock options exercised during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, was $56.3 million, $13.0 million and\n\n$0 million, respectively.\nPhantom Units\n\nPrior to the IPO, employees, directors, and consultants were granted phantom unit awards (the \u201cPhantom Units\u201d) under the Company\u2019s Phantom Equity\nIncentive Plan (the \u201cPhantom Incentive Plan\u201d). As of September 30, 2021, the Company determined that achievement of the performance conditions related\nto awards granted under the Phantom Incentive Plan was not probable and therefore, no expense was recognized for the phantom units during the fiscal year\nended September 30, 2021. The completion of the IPO on November 1, 2021 resulted in achievement of the performance condition for the majority of the\nunderlying  awards  granted  under  the  Phantom  Incentive  Plan.  The  outstanding  awards  relate  to  a  modification  previously  made  at  the  time  of  the  IPO\nrelated to awards granted to the Company\u2019s officers. We do not expect to make any further awards under the Phantom Incentive Plan. The following table\npresents information concerning the outstanding Phantom Units granted by the Company:\n\n105\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Outstanding as of October 1, 2022\nGranted\nVested\nForfeited\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2023\n\nNumber of Units\n\n605,591 \n\u2014 \n(304,261)\n(44,395)\n256,935 \n\nTotal  compensation  cost  related  to  non-vested  awards  not  yet  recognized  as  of  September  30,  2023  totaled  $1.6  million,  and  is  expected  to  be\nrecognized over a weighted average period of 0.6 years. The fair value of Phantom Units that vested during the year ended September 30, 2023, was $8.5\nmillion. There is no contractual term on the Phantom Units.\n\n2021 Stock-Based Compensation Plan\n\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company established the 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the \u201c2021 Incentive Plan\u201d) which reserves 9,500,000 shares of Class\nA  common  stock  of  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  for  issuance  to  management,  other  employees,  consultants,  and  board  members  of  the  Company.  The  2021\nIncentive Plan governs both equity-based and cash-based awards, including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, and restricted stock units\n(\u201cRSUs\u201d). Employee stock-based awards currently issued pursuant to the 2021 Incentive Plan that are expected to be settled by issuing shares of Class A\ncommon stock are recorded as equity awards. The 2021 Incentive Plan is accounted for as an equity plan. The current awards under the 2021 Incentive Plan\nvest ratably at one-third annually on the anniversary of the grant date over a three-year period. The Company generally expenses the grant date fair value of\nthe awards on a straight-line basis over each of the three separately vesting tranches within a given grant. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they\noccur. The following table summarizes activity under the 2021 Plan:\n\nOutstanding as of October 1, 2022\nGranted\nVested\nForfeited\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2023\n\nNumber of RSUs\n\n2,156,893 \n774,473 \n(691,489)\n(396,307)\n1,843,570 \n\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of the RSUs under the 2021 Incentive Plan was $20.29 and the currently granted RSUs generally vest in\nthree equal annual installments. Total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized as of September 30, 2023, was $18.0 million and is\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1 years. There is no contractual term on the RSUs granted under the 2021 Plan.\nOther\n\nIn  connection  with  the  acquisition  of  Nispera  AG  in  2022,  Fluence  issued  500,000  shares  of  restricted  stock  to  Nispera\u2019s  management  team.  The\nestimated post combination expense to the Company as a result of the business combination was approximately $6.9 million which will be recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the remaining service period that was stipulated in each holder\u2019s original RSU agreement.\n\nIn connection with the Phantom Units, the Company incurred $3.0 million in stock-based compensation expense which was settled in cash for the year\n\nend September 30, 2022.\n\nIn relation to awards previously granted to the Company\u2019s former CEO (Coughlin), who served as a director of the Company through the date of the\nIPO, in connection with separation, the Coughlin award modification 1) accelerated the vesting of phantom units to the IPO date that would have otherwise\nvested on the six-month anniversary of the consummation, and 2) accelerated the vesting of unit options to the IPO date that would have otherwise vested on\nApril 2, 2022 assuming continued service. The resolution stipulates that the awards subject to accelerated vesting were to be settled fully in cash, using the\nIPO  price  to  calculate  the  settlement  value.  All  other  equity  awards  granted  to  the  individual  were  concurrently  cancelled.  Incremental  stock-based\ncompensation expense related to the modification was $5.7 million, which was recognized fully during the three months ended December 31, 2021.\n\nStock-based compensation expense\n\nThe stock-based compensation expense was recorded as follows (in thousands):\n\n106\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##in thousands\nCost of goods and services\nResearch and development\nSales and marketing\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n\n18.

Investment in Joint Venture\n\nOn August 5, 2022, Fluence Energy Singapore PTE. LTD., a subsidiary of Fluence Energy, LLC, and ReNew Power entered into an agreement to form\na partnership in India for an initial investment of $5.0 million, plus a line of credit of $15.0 million each for a 50% interest in the partnership. We funded the\ninvestment and the joint venture commenced operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The investment is recorded in \u201cOther non-current assets\u201d on\nour consolidated balance sheet. The investment is accounted for under the equity method with results being reported by Fluence one quarter in arrears.

Organization and Operations\n\nFluence Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d and the \u201cParent Company\u201d), was formed on June 21, 2021. We conduct our business\noperations  through  Fluence  Energy,  LLC  and  its  direct  and  indirect  subsidiaries.  Upon  the  completion  of  our  Initial  Public  Offering  (the  \u201cIPO\u201d)  on\nNovember  1,  2021,  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  became  a  holding  company  whose  sole  material  assets  are  the  limited  liability  interests  (\u201cLLC  Interests\u201d)  in\nFluence Energy, LLC. All of our business is conducted through Fluence Energy, LLC, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Fluence Energy, LLC\nis treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and, as a result, its members, including Fluence Energy, Inc. will pay income taxes with respect to\ntheir allocable shares of its net taxable income.\n\nOur fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. References to \u201cfiscal year 2022\u201d and \u201cfiscal year 2023\u201d refer to the fiscal years ended\n\nSeptember 30, 2022 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nOn November 1, 2021, the Parent Company completed an IPO and a series of organization transactions (collectively with the IPO, the \u201cTransactions\u201d),\nin which the Company issued and sold 35,650,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the \u201cClass A common stock\u201d), at the\npublic offering price of $28.00 per share, which includes the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 4,650,000 shares of the\nClass  A  common  stock.  The  net  proceeds  to  the  Company  from  the  IPO  were  $948.0  million,  after  deducting  underwriting  discounts.  Other  offering\nexpenses incurred related to the IPO were paid for by Fluence Energy, LLC.\n\n2. Basis of Presentation\n\nThese condensed parent company financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Fluence Energy, Inc.\nand  the  accompanying  notes  thereto,  included  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K.  For  purposes  of  these  condensed  financial  statements,  the  Parent\nCompany's interest in Fluence Energy LLC is recorded based upon its proportionate share of Fluence Energy, LLC\u2019s net assets (similar to presenting them\non the equity method).\n\nCertain  intercompany  balances  presented  in  these  condensed  Parent  Company  financial  statements  are  eliminated  in  the  consolidated  financial\n\nstatements. $1.5 million and $0.2 million of payables were eliminated in consolidation as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.\n\n3. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nOn October 27, 2021, the Parent Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement (the \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d) with Fluence Energy, LLC,\nSiemens Industry, Inc., and AES Grid Stability, LLC (collectively, the \u201cFounders\u201d) which obligates the Company to make payments to the Founders of 85%\nof  the  amount  of  certain  tax  benefits  that  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  actually  realizes,  or  in  some  circumstances  is  deemed  to  realize,  arising  from  the  basis\nadjustments  and  certain  other  tax  benefits  arising  from  payments  made  under  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement.  Increases  in  tax  basis  and  tax  basis\nadjustments  generated  over  time  may  increase  (for  tax  purposes)  the  depreciation  and  amortization  deductions  available  to  Fluence  Energy,  Inc.  and,\ntherefore, may reduce the amount of U.S. federal, state, and local tax that Fluence Energy, Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the\nInternal Revenue Service may challenge all or part of the validity of that tax basis, and a court could sustain such a challenge.\n\nThe amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement are contingent upon (i) sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefits; (ii) Fluence\nEnergy, LLC is able to fully depreciate or amortize its assets; and (iii) no material changes in applicable tax law. The payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of Fluence Energy LLC by the Founders. As of September 30, 2023, we determined it is not\nprobable that payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would be made, given there was no expectation of future sufficient taxable income over the\nterm of the agreement to utilize deductions in the future.\n\nRefer  to  \u201cNote  14  -  Commitment  and  Contingencies\u201d  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  information  regarding  pending  and  threatening\n\nlitigation.\n\n111\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##SCHEDULE II.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone.\n\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objective that information in our Exchange\nAct reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified and pursuant to the requirements of the SEC\u2019s rules and forms\nand that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management\nrecognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired\ncontrol objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2023, the end of\nthe period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, and as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over\nfinancial reporting described below, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the\nreasonable assurance level.\n\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Under the supervision and with\nthe participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nBased  on  this  evaluation,  our  management  has  concluded  the  Company  did  not  maintain  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of\n\nSeptember 30, 2023 as a result of the existence of the material weakness discussed below.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems\n\ndetermined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent\n\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8.\n\n112\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##Material Weaknesses and Remediation Measures\n\nA  material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a  combination  of  deficiencies,  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  such  that  there  is  a  reasonable\n\npossibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nWe previously reported a material weakness in internal control over revenue recognition and related inventory.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the material weakness in internal control over revenue recognition has not fully been remediated. The Company\u2019s controls\nrelated to its estimate at completion (\u201cEAC\u201d), which is used in the Company\u2019s percentage of completion (\u201cPOC\u201d) accounting for its battery energy storage\nsolutions were not effective.\n\nWe assessed the material weakness as not remediated as the EAC controls did not consistently operate for a sufficient period of time and due to control\noperating effectiveness issues identified in management\u2019s assessment of controls. Certain aspects of the prior year material weakness have been successfully\nremediated as it relates to inventory and liquidated damages. In fiscal year 2024, management has or will (1) strengthen the process to determine the EAC;\n(2) provide training on the enhanced process to the control preparers and reviewers and (3) increase the level of evidence retained by the control owners\nwhen performing their review procedures and testing the completeness and accuracy of key inputs into the EAC.\n\nThe  actions  that  we  are  taking  are  subject  to  ongoing  senior  management  review,  as  well  as  Audit  Committee  oversight.  We  are  committed  to\nmaintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material\nweakness are remediated as soon as possible; we believe our efforts listed above will enable us to successfully remediate our material weakness in fiscal\nyear 2024 however, we cannot provide assurance as to when our further remediation measures will be complete. We will consider the material weakness\nremediated  after  the  applicable  controls  operate  for  a  sufficient  period  of  time,  and  management  has  concluded,  through  testing,  that  the  controls  are\noperating effectively.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOther than the changes to our internal control over financial reporting described in \u201cMaterial Weaknesses and Remediation Measures\u201d above, there\nwere no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter\nended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nITEM 9B.

The \u201cThree-Year Period\u201d also includes any transition period (that results from a change in the Company\u2019s\nfiscal year) within or immediately following the three completed fiscal years identified in the preceding sentence. However, a\ntransition period between the last day of the Company\u2019s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that\ncomprises a period of nine to 12 months shall be deemed a completed fiscal year.\n\n4\n\n\f"}
